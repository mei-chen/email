Speech from Prime Minister Stephen Harper:

My fellow Canadians, for the second time this week there has been a brutal and
violent attack on our soil.

Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Corporal Nathan
Cirillo of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

Corporal Cirillo was killed today - murdered in cold blood - as he provided a
ceremonial honour guard at Canada’s national war memorial.

That sacred place that pays tribute to those who gave their lives so that we can live
in a free, democratic and safe society.

Likewise, our thoughts and prayers remain also with the family and friends of Warrant
Officer Patrice Vincent, who was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired
terrorist.

Tonight we also pray for the speedy recovery of the others injured in these
despicable attacks.

Fellow Canadians, we have also been reminded today of the compassionate and
courageous nature of so many Canadians, like those private citizens and first
responders who came to provide aid to Corporal Cirillo as he fought for his life.

And, of course, the members of our security forces in the RCMP, the city of Ottawa
police, and in parliament who came quickly, and at great risk to themselves, to
assist those of us who were close to the attack.

Fellow Canadians, in the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any
accomplices he may have had.

But this week’s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of
terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world.

We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and our institutions of
governance are, by their very nature, attacks on our country.

On our values, on our society, on us, Canadians, as a free and democratic people who
embrace human dignity for all.

But let there be no misunderstanding, we will not be intimidated.  Canada will never
be intimidated.

In fact, this will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and
those of our national security agencies, to take all necessary steps to identify and
counter threats, and keep Canada safe here at home.

Just as it will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts to work
with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who
brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our
shores.

They will have no safe haven.

While today has been, without question, a difficult day, I have every confidence that
Canadians will pull together with the kind of firm solidarity that has seen our
country through many challenges.

Together, we will remain vigilant against those, at home or abroad, who wish to harm
us.

For now, Laureen, Ben, Rachel, and I join all Canadians in praying for those touched
by today’s attack.

May God bless them, and keep our land glorious and free.

Friend,

As a father to two amazing young children, I can’t tell you how excited my wife and I
are about what Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced today.

You already know our Conservative record on supporting Canadian families: we’ve
lowered taxes, put money back in your pocket, and allowed the real childcare experts
– Mom and Dad – to decide how best to raise their kids.

Today we made a big addition to that record, with new tax cuts for Canadian families.

If you have children under the age of 18, you will get significant tax relief.

You can see how much your family will save here: www.conservative.ca/newtaxbreaks
(http://www.conservative.ca/NewTaxBreaks/)

These new tax cuts will put more than $4.6 billion back into the pockets of over 4
million Canadian families. Of the benefits we’re introducing, more than two-thirds
will go to low and middle-income families.

I’m proud to be part of a Conservative team that consistently puts Canadian families
first by delivering real tax relief and by allowing parents the flexibility to make
the best decisions for needs of their children.

Have a look at how we’re supporting Canadian families, and let us know you support
lower taxes: www.conservative.ca/newtaxbreaks

Friend,

Lower taxes for Canadian families.

Sounds like a no-brainer, right?

We certainly think so. That’s why our Conservative Government is keeping its promise
and putting approximately $1,140 back into the pockets of Canadian parents to help
make life more affordable.

We’re also making sure it helps the people who need it most. Two-thirds of the
benefits are going to low and middle income Canadians.

If you support these tax breaks for Canadian families, will you chip in $25 today? (h
ttps://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=cbbeb9ab39&vpi=b&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new
taxbreaks)

Shockingly, not everyone thinks you deserve a tax break.

Justin Trudeau is promising to roll back Conservative tax breaks so he can raise
government spending.  Thomas Mulcair wants the government to control child care,
which will take choices away from parents and cost us billions of dollars.

Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair have said that they oppose our Prime Minister’s
family tax cut plan.

It’s clear that the only people putting Canadian parents first with tax relief is
Canada’s Conservatives. Chip in $25 today to help us keep Canada on the right path. (

Mike,

Even though I’ve been in politics for some time, I’m still occasionally shocked by
what I see.

For example, I never thought the Liberals would play politics with something as
simple and meaningful as our new tax breaks for Canadian families.

These tax breaks are based on something Canadian parents know all too well: Raising
kids is expensive, so we’re making it easier.

If you support this simple idea, chip in $25 to let us know. (https://donate.conserva
tive.ca/NewTaxBreaks?mpi=4e7a77d59b&vpi=b&utm_source=donor&utm_medium=email&utm_campa
ign=newtaxbreaks)

Sadly, the reaction from the Liberals has been nothing but cynical.

Justin Trudeau is distorting this positive announcement to claim our tax cuts don’t
help middle-income Canadians.

Why would he say this when he knows the opposite is true? Because he wants to reverse
them in order to spend your tax dollars on programs he knows we can't afford.

These tax breaks are fair across the board and were made with middle-income Canadians
in mind. And don't let the Liberals tell you otherwise.

FACT: The benefits and tax breaks we put forward helps every Canadian family with
children – over 4 million of them.

Justin Trudeau has resorted to distorting the facts to hardworking parents, all to
fund his own high tax, high debt agenda.

That’s why I’m writing to you today. Because Liberals are out there trying to sell
you tax hikes, rather than supporting our tax breaks – and we need to make sure
Canadians know the truth.

Chip in $25 today to help us fight back against the lies and smears. (https://donate.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper has introduced new tax breaks that will benefit every
family in Canada with kids. Justin Trudeau has promised to reverse these breaks if
given the chance.

Prime Minister Harper has lowered taxes for ALL Canadians while strengthening the
Canadian economy. Justin Trudeau is promising higher taxes and more debt.

After years of hard work, Prime Minister Harper and the Conservatives will balance
the budget in 2015. Justin Trudeau thinks budgets “balance themselves” and has
promised to undo all of our hard work.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a moral leader on the world stage. Justin Trudeau’s
foreign policy consists of immature jokes and incoherence.

The choice is clear. With Prime Minister Harper and Canada’s Conservatives, we can
count on even more of the strong, dependable leadership which has brought us this
far. Justin Trudeau, with his high-tax, high-debt schemes, is just not up to the
serious job of leading the country.

But Justin Trudeau's comments last week show that he does not understand the gravity

fragile. Many of the world's largest economies are struggling to grow out of the
recession.

Now is not the time for risky experiments to raise taxes on Canadian families. The
threat of long-term economic decline is real.

Thankfully, Canada has grown under the strong, dependable leadership of Prime
Minister Stephen Harper. We have created over 1.2 million new jobs since the
recession. We have cut taxes for Canadians and are putting more money back in their
pockets.

In fact, your tax burden is now the lowest it has been in 60 years.

This is why I am so concerned to hear about the plans of the Liberals and NDP to
reverse the tax breaks we have put in place. Now is not the time to be raising taxes,
no matter what fancy language they use to hide their plans.

Canadians deserve a real plan to balance the budget, create more jobs, and keep

Minister is providing that leadership.

In May, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered a speech remembering the victims of
communism and committing Canada to the defense of freedom.  It was a profound
statement of this Prime Minister's commitment to these principles. I encourage you to
get a copy of the highlights here. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/victims-of-
communism-speech/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=34a5f522&vpi=b]

The commemorations and ceremonies held over the past week mark major advancements in
freedom and democracy around the world. They mark victories in the fight against the
forces of evil -- whether in the form of communism, fascism, or terrorism.

Today we continue the fight for freedom. We stand with people from Iraq to Israel to
the Ukraine who are fighting for freedom.

Get your copy of the Prime Minister's remarks [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc
/victims-of-communism-speech/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=34a5f522&vpi=c], and join me and
all Canadians in taking time this week to thank all those whose sacrifice has made
Canada the true North strong and free.

18,20141120,"Candice Bergen, MP",Vanity Fair? Let’s compare.,"Mike,

Being Prime Minister is a serious job that requires strong leadership.

When the stakes are high, we need to know we have a dependable, serious leader.

While Prime Minister Harper was getting things done on the world stage, protecting
Canada from a fragile global economy, let's look at what Justin Trudeau was up to:

While PM Harper was addressing the United Nations General Assembly ... Justin Trudeau
was giving a feature interview to Chatelaine for an article that lovingly described
his 'impeccable khakis and blue windowpane shirt.'  While PM Harper was brokering new
trade deals in Asia ... Justin Trudeau was out promoting his new book - a 331-page
version of his ""unique journey"" through life.  While PM Harper was in New Zealand
promoting Canada's trade relationship in the Asia-Pacific region ... Justin Trudeau
was preparing for the debut of his fluff piece in U.S. magazine Vanity Fair (spoiler
alert: the interview refers to him as being news 'since conception.')  While PM
Harper was announcing new tax breaks for hard-working Canadian families, saving
families over $1,100 more every year ... Justin Trudeau was criticizing them, and
promising to claw them back.

When you compare the actions of Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Harper side-by-
side, the difference is stark: Justin Trudeau is not up to the serious job of being
Prime Minister.

Show your support for the strong, dependable leadership Stephen Harper has shown as
Prime Minister with a $25 donation today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=b]

You and I both know that Canadians are better off with Prime Minister Harper. He is
guiding our recovery from a global recession, with over 1.2 million new jobs and
putting over $27 billion back in to the pockets of Canadian families. He is showing
strong leadership in a dangerous world – both on Russian aggression in Ukraine and
fighting ISIL.

Justin Trudeau? He's shown no grasp of the difficult work that a Prime Minister does.

19,20141121,"Cory Hann, Conservative Party of Canada",Re: New development,"Mike,

We all remember when Sid Ryan of the Ontario Federation of Labour vowed to set up a
""war room"" so he can fight us in the next election.

Many dismissed his overheated rhetoric as idle talk.

But last week we learned that a union representing some federal employees pledged to
""take all necessary"" political action to attack Prime Minister Harper and our
Conservatives in 2015.

This means that we're going to face a very difficult fight next fall, and we need to
be ready. Will you help us with a $55 donation today to prepare?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=c7901610&vpi=b]

Liberal and NDP candidates are going to be on the ballot, running against
Conservatives.  We'll have to run strong elections in 338 ridings to beat them so we
can win a second majority government next fall.

But Sid Ryan and people like him want to bully and influence our elections from the
outside, unaccountably spending all kinds of money to hurt us -- without ever running
for office.

We won't let that happen. We're going to take them on, and we're going to win.

But we're only going to be able to do it with your support.

Contribute $55 today to keep Prime Minister Harper and the Conservatives in
government. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=c7901610&vpi=c]

20,20141122,"Fred DeLorey, Conservative Party of Canada",When Harper met Putin,"Friend,

Prime Minister Harper has always shown strong leadership in a dangerous world. Last
week, he made us proud again.

Just 2 days after Russian troops re-entered Ukrainian territory, Vladimir Putin was
at the G20 summit in Australia. When he approached Prime Minister Harper for a
handshake, this is what the Prime Minister had to say to him:

""I guess I'll shake your hand, but I only have one thing to say to you: You need to
get out of Ukraine.""

If you support a Canadian leader who stands up to foreign bullies, let us know with a
$55 donation today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=34a5f522&vpi=b]

It also made me wonder: what would Justin Trudeau have done in this situation?

When the CBC interviewed him on the subject just a few weeks ago, Justin Trudeau
couldn't even answer.

They asked him, point blank: ""Putin is sitting in front of you. What do you say about
the situation in Ukraine?""

Trudeau's response: ""Well, what's the situation going to be in six months from now?""

He wouldn't respond – he couldn't respond – because the truth is he's dangerously
naive about this and other serious global issues that are a real threat to Canadians.

On the black and white issue of Russian aggression, Justin couldn't muster up a
coherent response.

By contrast, Canada has been very clear on Russian aggression against Ukraine.  Prime
Minster Harper has made Canada a respected leader in the world on this and other
issues.

If you, like me, are proud of our Country's record, help keep our strong, dependable
leader in the Prime Minister's chair.  Chip in $55 to support PM Harper and the
Conservative Party today.

You already know that the Conservative Party of Canada depends on your contributions.

But did you know that the Canadian tax system offers a generous tax credit to
individuals who donate to the Conservative Party?

Here's how it works:

A donation of $100 can offer a credit of up to $75;   A donation of $200 can offer a
credit of up to $150;  A donation of $500 can offer a credit of up to $350; and  A
donation of $1200 – the maximum allowed – can offer a tax credit of up to $625
(that's more than half the amount of the gift!)

But there's a catch: These credits reset every calendar year.

So if you haven't made your donation for 2014 yet, you have just 32 days left to make
your contribution count.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/eoq4?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=b]

We're hoping that 2014 will be a record year for us.   To be a part of it, you have

We can't allow the opposition to silence us with millions of dollars of money from

update of our 2014 fundraising results.

I want to be able to tell him that we are on track to make Conservative Party history

P.S.  --  I want to thank you for being such a strong supporter of the Conservative
Party and of the Prime Minister Harper. We have accomplished a lot in making our

35,20141215,"Kevin Sorenson, MP","What does $3,400 mean?","Mike,

When we talk about lowering taxes, we're talking about putting more money back into
your pocket.

And with Stephen Harper's leadership, that works out to more than $3,400 this year
for an average family.

According to Statistics Canada, for the average family, $3,400 in a single year is:

More than they spend on health care;  As much as they spend on clothing and
accessories; and  Almost half of what they spend on food!

That's what money back in the pockets of Canadians means.  It means families are
better able to afford the basics, and put money towards what matters to them.

So if you want to see even more money back in your wallet, support our Prime Minister
with a $75 donation today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/eoq4?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=fdabeddc&vpi=b]

The other parties would have you believe that our tax cuts don't help families, but
that's because they don't trust you to spend your own hard-earned money.

They think they can spend your money better than you can.

They're wrong. You know it and I know it.

Donate $75 today to support our plan to balance the budget in 2015, and keep putting
more money back in your pocket.

--Canada's middle class was named ""the world's richest""
--Free trade agreements were signed with the European Union and South Korea
--Significant Family Tax Cuts were introduced
--And we're STILL on track to balance the budget in 2015
 
But there's still so much more to do.

I'm proud of all the things our government is doing for families.

Sure, there is the ""big stuff"" to note -- like cutting taxes 180 times since we were
first elected.

But there are also lots of little things you may not have heard about.

For example: did you know that we're cracking down on companies that overcharge
Canadians for goods just because we live in Canada? We believe that sort of
geographical price discrimination is unfair to Canadians.

We're also putting an end to unfair practices, such as companies charging consumers
for the ""privilege"" of getting a paper copy of their wireless bill.   (That's like
""paying to pay"").

Also, did you know we're making sure 98% of Canadians have access to high speed
internet? And that we're working to improve access to Canadian wine, beer, and cheese
made in different provinces?

Despite all these big and small achievements --- there's so much more left to do!
With less than a year til the election, help us protect all the progress we've made

Don't Canadians have a right to expect their political leaders to consistently
support projects that will create large numbers of good Canadian jobs?

I certainly think so.

But Justin Trudeau's recent opposition to the job-creating Energy East project raises
serious concerns about his judgement to lead our economy forward.

When he was in my province of New Brunswick this Spring, he said he was ""supportive
of the idea of a west to east pipeline"" that will deliver jobs and growth to Atlantic
Canada.

But when he was in Quebec just last week, he said the very opposite – that the
pipeline ""is not socially acceptable.""

Please take a minute to read my new column on Trudeau's deceitful comments.

Canadians deserve clear commitments from their leaders. And they deserve leaders who
take a principled stance – not play petty political games.

What am I hearing? People are interested in good, well-paying jobs. Parents want
their kids to find and keep a good job. Young people want a job they can turn into a
career.

Many of people I spoke with have considered the skilled trades, but getting the
training can be an obstacle -- not everyone can afford to take time away from work to
become an apprentice.

The Apprentice Loan Program will help more than 26,000 people each year with loans of
up to $4,000/period of technical training. These loans will be interest-free until
the recipient completes or leaves their training program.

I'm proud to be part of this Conservative government that is opening access to good,
well-paying jobs for Canadians.

Read Minister Findlay's article, and let me know that you support this important new
program. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/open-for-

I'm sorry to have to do this, but I have some disturbing news to share with you.

I was recently made aware of a plan by Quebec's largest trade union, the FTQ, to
attack Conservative candidates in 8 ridings. Even worse, this is part of a larger
plan by a group of unions to unseat Conservatives in 60 ridings across Canada!

The plan, called ""Beat the Conservatives,"" is a clear attack on a fundamental
Canadian principle of democracy.

$45 to help us in this fight. [https://donate.conservative.ca/protect-

It's this simple. We're up against a secretive group of union leaders who have access
to millions of dollars and a single goal – to defeat Prime Minister Harper and
Canada's Conservatives.

And we can't count on the Liberals and NDP to speak out against this, as they are the
ones who stand to benefit.

It may be a new year – but it's the same old Ottawa media elite.

We're seeing more of the same selective reporting that defined their coverage in
2014.

The proof is everywhere.

For example, you probably heard about Justin Trudeau's immature remarks about
""whipping out"" Canada's CF-18s in response to the genocidal evil of ISIL. But did you
know that he has TWICE refused to apologize for those remarks, choosing instead to
double down on his childish statement?

You can be excused – it didn't make the press ( Help us fight back!
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=b])

Another example, this one even more shocking: Trudeau has been playing a divisive
political game with Canada's regions – telling audiences in Alberta and New Brunswick
that he supports the Energy East pipeline, but saying the exact opposite to an anti-
pipeline crowd in Quebec.

Again, you probably didn't hear these stories. They barely made a blip on the radar
screen of the Liberal-friendly media. They are so excited about Justin Trudeau's
candidacy that they are handing him a free pass.

Mike, It's clear that as this year's election approaches, we'll be fighting not only
the Liberals, but their friends in the Ottawa media elite, as well.

Canadian troops fighting the evil of ISIL as part of the international coalition need
to know that they have the support of Canadians – including elected political
representatives.

Sadly, Justin Trudeau couldn't manage to add his voice in support.

stakes?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=b]

He could have taken a firm stance supporting our troops and their good work. Instead,
he is playing a risky game of trying to score political points.

In Trudeau's eyes, training and supporting Iraqi Security Forces is unacceptable
because our troops have had to return fire when shot at by ISIL fighters.

Compare that to Prime Minister Harper's response last Sunday:

""If those guys fire at us, we're going to fire back and we're going to kill them.""

Taking a prominent role in a global fight against the evil of terrorism isn't
something to be taken lightly -- but it's a serious situation that our leaders have

As one of our strongest supporters, I want to share our Party's 2014 fundraising
results with you:

We raised an incredible $20.1 million in 2014 -- a fundraising record for a non-
election year.  We saw more Canadians donate to us in a single quarter than ever
before (for a non-election year).  But most impressively of all, we ended the year
strong. The fourth quarter of 2014 was our best in a decade -- even including
election years.  In fact, we increased our lead over the Liberals compared to Q4 of
2013.

In short, our Conservative donors once again stepped up to the challenge, and gave
our party a big boost when we needed it most.

minute.  Help us keep the momentum rolling in 2015 with a $45 donation today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=b]

As always, we can't count on the Ottawa media elite to report the results fairly --
even though we raised the most money. Here's how the Ottawa Citizen spun the results:

""The federal Liberals are reporting a big jump in fundraising revenues for the last
quarter of 2014, up 24 per cent from the same period in 2013. [...] But more
encouraging for Justin Trudeau's party will be the eight per cent rise in the number
of donors who gave to the party.""*

What's the problem with that?  They left out that we, too, had a 24 per cent rise in
donations.

Even more glaringly, they conveniently ignored our incredible 28% increase in donors.
That's 20% over the Liberals -- but somehow ""encouraging"" for them.

Mike, this is what we're up against.

We simply cannot let the media elite and the opposition parties try to spin our
victory into a loss.   Help us fight back. Click here to make your contribution for

Most people understand that it's the job of our government to protect our country
from the threat of terrorism.

their unspeakable acts of terror in Canada. Instead, she blames Prime Minister
Harper, saying, ""If they're coming here it's because he put us in that position.""*

She also shows a lack of understanding on what the fight against ISIL is about,
saying the only reason Canada joined our allies in Iraq is to ""instill fear in

72,20150218,"Chris Alexander, MP",Full face covering during the citizenship ceremony?,"Mike,

Our Conservative Government believes that taking the Oath of Citizenship is an
important step in affirming one's commitment to Canadian values and traditions.

At the very moment newcomers are joining the Canadian family, we believe new citizens
should recite the oath proudly, loudly and for everyone to see and hear.

That's why our Conservative government strongly opposes the wearing of a niqab – or
any face covering – that would stand in the way of reciting the Oath of Citizenship
and pledging allegiance to Canada and our Queen.

Canadian citizenship confers both rights and responsibilities. The rules for
obtaining it should apply ‎equally to all.

We believe that when someone becomes a Canadian citizen, they should embrace our
culture and everything that makes us proud to be Canadian. That should be done
without interference, freely and openly. It's why we filed a notice to appeal this
week's court decision allowing people to wear the hijab while taking the Oath.

As Prime Minister Harper said in Quebec yesterday:

""It is offensive that someone would hide their identity at the very moment where they
are committing to join the Canadian family.""

Add your name if you agree with our Prime Minister. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc

I'm proud of our Conservative government's strong emphasis on protecting Canadian
women and girls from barbaric cultural practices.

I recently read about the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) – a horrific
custom still practiced in some parts of the world – in England. It is estimated that
up to 170,000 women and girls living in the UK have had to undergo this practice.

Please take a minute to read more about how we are protecting Canada from barbaric
cultural practices. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/tough-stand-on-barbaric-
practices?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=f20f11bb&vpi=b]

Mike, we can't be complacent. We can't assume that countries like Canada are immune
from these practices.

That's why Canada's Conservatives explicitly condemned FGM in our 2011 citizenship
guide for new immigrants. It's also why we introduced our Zero Tolerance for Barbaric
Cultural Practices Act last year.

Our Conservative government believes that all women and girls who have chosen to make
Canada their home deserve the full protection of Canadian law.

That's why we have made it clear: cultural practices like FGM, child marriage, and
so-called ""honour killings"" are not acceptable.

88,20150314,"Jenni Byrne, National Campaign Manager",Headline from yesterday,"Mike,

As someone who grew up in a rural part of our country, I was proud to hear what the
Prime Minister had to say yesterday.

He said that gun ownership is important for safety for those of us who live a ways
from immediate police assistance.

Our Conservative party recognizes that guns play an important role in the
livelihoods, recreation, and safety of many Canadians. And we're standing up for
responsible gun-owning Canadians.

Click here and let me know you support all that we're doing for responsible gun
owners. [http://safeandsensible.ca/guns-important-for-safety-in-rural-
homes/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=d6f89c98&vpi=b]

But I need to contrast what we've done to simplify the rules for law-abiding gun
owners with what the other parties are proposing to do.

What does Trudeau have to say about it?

""I we have a vote tomorrow, I would vote once again to keep the long-gun registry.""

– Justin Trudeau, December 3, 2012

And NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair?

""The NDP's position on the gun registry is that we favour the registration of guns.""

– Thomas Mulcair, December 3, 2012

They want to make life harder for lawful hunters, farmers, and sport shooters by
bringing back the long gun registry. At the same time, they oppose everything we do
to punish criminals who commit crimes with guns!

This doesn't make any sense at all.

It's clear that only one party has the best interests of law-abiding gun owners at
heart. And we know what the Liberals and NDP will do if they get into office in
October.

Help us stop that from happening – sign your support. [http://safeandsensible.ca

Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canada has become a strong, moral leader in the
world. We're proud of the hard work it has taken to build that reputation.

But Justin Trudeau threatens to destroy all our hard work with his dangerously naïve
view of the world.

It's this simple: Justin Trudeau isn't worth the risk. Add your name if you agree.
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/high-risk-high-
stakes/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=b]

Justin Trudeau can't tell the difference between our allies and our enemies. He said
""picking sides has been problematic"" in the Middle East. (CPAC, May 7, 2013)

He lacks the ability to take foreign crises seriously – whether he's making jokes
about Russia invading Ukraine over a hockey game (Tout le Monde en Parle, Feb. 23,
2014), or about ""trying to whip out our CF-18s and show them how big they are"" (CTV
News, Oct. 2, 2014) as the Royal Canadian Air Force was sent to fight against the
brutality of ISIS.

We need strong moral leadership in the world, not Trudeau's admiration for China's
""basic dictatorship."" (CTV News, Nov. 10, 2013)

Not a leader that when asked whether he regretted saying he admired China, replied ""…
maybe we shouldn't be so smug about Canada."" (Xtra, Nov. 20, 2013)

We need a leader who will make us proud, not embarrassed.

Add your name if you agree Justin Trudeau doesn't have what it takes.

90,20150321,"Joy Smith, MP",Stopping human trafficking,"Mike,

Human trafficking must be stopped.

This horrendous crime targets young women and is quickly becoming the biggest
criminal enterprise in the world. These girls – some as young as 5 – are often forced
into the sex trade, leading to a life of exploitation and slavery.

I'm proud to have championed this cause as an MP over the past 11 years. I'm proud of
what our government has done to crack down on traffickers, and what we've done to
help victims and to protect potential victims.

Under a bill I introduced, child trafficking is a new criminal offence – with a
mandatory minimum sentence of five years.

We've made sure that any Canadian citizen or permanent resident who participates in
human trafficking outside Canada will be prosecuted in Canada.

And we're also working to educate and protect the victims of these crimes.

Today, Justice Minister Peter MacKay announced funding for Concertation des luttes
contre l'exploitation sexuelle (CLES). CLES is a community-based group in Montreal
dedicated to supporting women and girls who have been victims of sex trafficking.
They work with victims of human trafficking, and the people most at risk of becoming
victims.

They are helping these women understand their rights and help them exit a life of
exploitation.

In partnership with groups like CLES, we can empower victims of sexual and human
trafficking, as well as those most at risk of being exploited.

The measures we have taken – and continue to take – will benefit mothers, daughters,
and women here in Canada and around the world. I'm proud of our role in the fight
against human trafficking.

Is it safe to say we've finally escaped winter's grip? I don't know about you, but
I'm ready for the fresh start of spring.

As the Conservative Party's Executive Director, I cannot forget to tell you that the
end of winter also means the end of our first fiscal quarter. It's the first time
this year that we publish our fundraising results.

I noticed that you generously helped us with a donation in 2014. If you've been
thinking about donating to the Conservative Party again this year, there is no better
time than right now.

Will you make a $150 donation to our election efforts, as part of your fresh start
this spring?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/eoq1-2015?mpi=[campaignid]&val=150&vpi=b]

Your gift goes directly towards helping us prepare for the election campaign this
fall.

Our analysis tells us that the Liberals are seeing increasingly positive success in
their fundraising efforts.

We believe that they intend to start aggressively advertising to attack the Prime
Minister, perhaps as early as this spring. And they desperately want to report an
impressive first quarter to try and gain momentum before the upcoming election.

Mike, I'm sure you agree: we can't let them get ahead.  Help us maintain our
advantage over Trudeau's Liberals with a donation today.

If you support us on this, please let me know here. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc
/protecting-canadians/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=343a80aa&vpi=b]

This is important for two reasons.

The first is we want to prevent the spread of radical jihad here in Canada.

Those who would attempt to abuse the rights enjoyed by Canadians to spread their
ideology of hate must be stopped.

We also want to prevent the heartache of families who have learned that their sons
and daughters have, aided by these criminals, flown to Iraq and Syria.

Already we've seen too many cases where this has happened, or has almost happened.

Twin brothers in Ottawa were stopped as they were about to leave the country, but six
teens from Montreal are now believed to be in Syria.

Our new legislation will give our police and security forces the tools they need to
prevent these cases in the future.

So please, show your support for this vital legislation. Let me know you support the
efforts of our Conservative team to combat the recruitment of Canadians for radical
jihadist terrorist groups like ISIS. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/protecting-

It's at times like this that I am most proud of our Conservative party and our

Yesterday, the Prime Minister laid out a clear and direct case for extending and
expanding our mission against the evil of ISIL.

Download a copy of the PM's speech and read it for yourself here.

Our objective is clear: degrade ISIL to the point where they are no longer a threat
to Canada.

Our efforts are working. With our coalition allies we are slowly pushing ISIL back –
reclaiming the territory they have been brutalizing.

Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair are opposed to this important mission. But I know
the Canadian people side with Prime Minister Harper and see the vital necessity of
our mission.

Take a minute to read the Prime Minister's speech here – and share it with a friend

It is unacceptable that some repeat violent offenders serve only 2/3 of their
sentence in jail and 1/3 in our communities.

That is why our Conservative team is putting an end to this practice – called
statutory release for these dangerous criminals.  Let me know you agree that a 3-year
sentence should mean 3 years in jail – not 2. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/do-the-
time/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=239f14d3&vpi=b]

There are many reasons repeat violent offenders should stay in jail. Most
importantly, it keeps them away from potential victims in our communities. It also
gives them more time to change the behaviours that contribute to reoffending.

As Prime Minister Harper has said:

""It is unacceptable that Canadians fall prey to violent offenders, who have benefited
from early release after repeatedly committing violent crimes.""

While our Conservative team is putting the rights of victims before the rights of
criminals, Justin Trudeau has said he ""wouldn't rule our repealing mandatory minimums
for anyone.""

104,20150405,"Greg Rickford, MP",A risky and ridiculous scheme,"Mike,

What does Justin Trudeau's carbon pricing scheme mean for you?

Justin Trudeau says Canada needs a price on carbon, and his scheme will require it.
That means higher prices on every single thing you buy.

He's also promised a Medicare-sized new transfer to pay them for raising your taxes.
That would mean $34 billion more out of your pocket.

If you think this is a terrible idea – I know I do – please let me know here.
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/justin-trudeaus-carbon-
tax/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=b]

If he's going to pay the provinces $34-billion to raise your taxes, he's going to
need to get the money. That means your taxes are going up or Canada going back into
deficit – or both.

To recap: Justin Trudeau's plan is to force the provinces to raise your taxes, then
raise your taxes again to pay them to do it.

This scheme is risky and ridiculous. If you're as outraged as I am, add your name
right now:  http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/justin-trudeaus-carbon-tax/
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/justin-trudeaus-carbon-
tax/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&vpi=c]

Only someone with a trust fund, like Justin Trudeau, would think middle class
Canadian families can afford higher prices and more taxes. That's why he's promising
to raise them.

As always, Canadians can count on Prime Minister Harper and our Conservative party to
do the opposite. We are committed to lowering your taxes and making life easier for

A balanced budget means our government doesn't have to borrow billions of dollars
from foreign countries to make ends meet.

It means more money for tax relief – lower taxes for you and your family, and an
economically strong Canada.

So why is Justin Trudeau so eager to push us back into a deficit?

His risky schemes would require Canada go to countries around the world, cap in hand,
to borrow billions of dollars.

At the same time, your taxes would go up, and money that should stay in your pocket
would go to fund Justin's ridiculous carbon pricing scheme.

We can't let this happen. Justin Trudeau's plans will hurt our families and our
economy. That's why we're committed to fighting against Justin Trudeau's high-tax,
high-debt schemes.

Help us win that fight with a $55 donation today.

Instead of raising taxes, we are lowering them. Instead of increasing the deficit, we
are bringing balance to our books.

Conservatives know that a balanced budget benefits all Canadians. That's why we're so
proud to unveil our budget – fully balanced as promised – on April 21.

Every day you and your family make tough decisions on how to spend your money. You
work hard to ensure that you not spend more than you make.

And you are right to expect your government to do the same!

Just like families cannot put off their mortgage and car insurance payments forever,
governments cannot keep on spending more than they bring in. The books need to be
balanced.

This is why we are introducing  balanced budget legislation.
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/balanced-budgets-for-canadas-
future/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=fdabeddc&vpi=b]

Our legislation will require that Canada's budget be balanced, except in
extraordinary circumstances like recession, war, or natural disasters. Governments
that decide to ignore this law, and go back into deficit, will see Cabinet ministers
take a 5% pay cut until they restore balance.

This legislation comes at a vital time for Canada. We are at a crossroads.

Our Conservative party is committed to balanced budgets and lower taxes. The
alternative is a return to the dark times of the 1970s, where Canada was plunged deep
into deficits that caused decades of hardship for Canadians and our economy.

Today we see that same approach being taken by the opposition parties. Justin
Trudeau's schemes will mean higher taxes for you, and huge deficits for Canada.

We need to protect the financial security of our economy – we need balanced budget
legislation.

As Canada's Minister of State for Finance, I have the privilege of travelling across

At every single stop I am thanked for our Government's commitment to balance Canada's
budget. Canadians understand the importance of fiscal balance for Canada.

But once in a while, I hear the question ""Why balance the budget? Does it really
matter?""

My answer is always the same: YES! A balanced budget matters, because it benefits all
Canadians.

Here's what I mean:

A balanced budget keeps interest rates low:

A balanced budget helps secure Canada's top AAA credit rating. This means low
interest rates for people like you and me. Canadians struggled when interest rates
went over of 16% due to the reckless schemes of Pierre Trudeau. Our Conservative team
will never repeat those mistakes.    A balanced budget means security:

We live in a global economy. Things happen that we can't predict, like war or a
sudden plunge in oil prices. A balanced budget means we can deal with these issues as
they arise – and do so without sacrificing our country's future.    A balanced budget
means investment:

Your tax dollars should go towards the things that matter most to you. With our
balanced budget, taxpayer dollars support important programs like health care – not
interest payments.

I've had a good laugh listening to the other parties pay lip service to the serious
task of managing Canada's budget.

Take, for example, Justin Trudeau's risky carbon pricing scheme. He wants to:

Force the provinces to put a price on carbon - increasing the cost of everything you
and your family buy.  Make a $34 billion dollar transfer to the provinces for it.
And either raise your taxes to pay for it, plunge the country back into a deficit, or
worse - both!

Now compare that to our Conservative focus.

We're going to use our newly balanced budget to lower your taxes instead of raise
them. We're going to make life easier, instead of making it harder.

And we're going to ensure that this is always the case in Canada, by introducing
Balanced Budget Legislation.

Here are the facts:

You can now contribute $10,000 each year to your TFSA  Over 10.7 million Canadians

budget, he's ignoring reality. Worse, he's threatening the savings and investments of
millions of Canadians – especially seniors and people about to retire.

Instead of supporting more opportunities for Canadians to save, Justin's Liberals
will take away the increased TFSA limits.

He'd rather raise your taxes than let you save $10,000/year tax-free.

How? Here's two examples:

Let's say you make a  one-time donation of $100 to support our Conservative Party

you a 2015 tax receipt, and you will be eligible for a tax credit of up to $75

$25!  Or, let's say you give just $10 per month, starting this month. When you file
your taxes early next year, you'll be eligible for a tax credit of up to $67.50,

I think we can all agree: nobody likes doing their taxes.

Thankfully, I'm done with mine for another year. After seeing the impact that the
credit from my Conservative Party donation made on my taxes, it reminded me to send
you a quick note.

<<<<Quick Check: Have you made your 2015 donation yet?>>>>
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=b]

You see, a CPC Supporter who donates, say $100, can see a big tax credit on their
donation.  How big? For that $100 donation, the tax credit can be up to $75.

You read that right: the net cost of $100 donation can be as low as $25.*

Why? Because the CRA allows for generous tax credits for political contributions. It
works something like this:

Your Donation Amount  Your Tax Credit Up To:      $25  $18.75    $50  $37.50    $100
$75    $300  $225

As you can see, you can get quite a bit back on your donation.

So, while it's too late to donate for a tax credit this spring,  you should make your
2015 donation NOW to make sure there will be a tax receipt with YOUR name on it next
year. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=c]*

the marginal tax rate,""* according to tax expert Professor Jack Mintz.

Government was an era of neglect, with an aggressive cutting of funding to all
aspects of the Canadian military.

Now, there is our Conservative approach. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/supporting-
our-canadian-armed-forces/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=343a80aa&vpi=b]

We are increasing funding for our Canadian Armed Forces by $12 billion – with funding
increasing 3% each year over 10 years.

We know that government has no greater responsibility than protecting the security
and lives of Canadians.

In a world where ISIS and its affiliates threaten Canadians and commit genocide
abroad, we cannot afford to take the Liberal approach of slashing funding for our
military.

So instead, we are expanding our capacity to deliver training assistance to Ukraine,
we are providing funding for the extended mission against ISIS as part of the
international coalition, and we are protecting Canada's cyber systems.

We are doing all this while balancing the budget and lowering taxes for Canadians.

Share your support for this important priority today. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc

Canadian small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They employ half of all
Canadians working in the private sector. They fill our main streets, support local
events and charities, and are the foundations of our communities.

We want to encourage entrepreneurs to start and grow their small businesses. That's
why we have lowered their taxes and cut red tape since 2006.

Now I'm proud to announce we are lowering the small business tax rate to 9%. This is
the largest tax rate cut for small businesses in more than 25 years.

Our strong, Conservative, balanced budget is working for small businesses.  Show that
YOU support our actions to boost Canadian small businesses with a $55 donation right
now. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=fdabeddc&val=55&vpi=b]

This lower tax rate will help small businesses keep $2.3 billion more of their
earnings. That means more investments and more new jobs across Canada.

Now compare that to what Justin Trudeau has planned:

He has promised to take away our tax cut for small businesses. Here's what he said on
the CBC:

CBC REPORTER: ""So you wouldn't support [the small business tax cut]?""

JUSTIN TRUDEAU: ""Not really. It needs to be redesigned.""*

He has also promised to bring in a new, expensive carbon tax – a tax that will raise
the price of everything.

The choice is clear: higher taxes and economic decline under Justin Trudeau, or lower
taxes and a stronger economy with Prime Minister Harper.

We need your help to stop Justin Trudeau. Do your part and chip in $55 today.

For many Canadian families, the Victoria Day long weekend is the start of summer.

It's also the start of a busy summer of Conservative candidates getting out into
their communities and meeting supporters.

Before heading off for the weekend, will you make a contribution to support our
Conservative Party? [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]
Your donation will help us in these vital days as we count down towards the coming
election.

As you get ready to enjoy the long weekend with your family, it's also great time to
look back on what the Conservative government has done to help all Canadian families:

We have enhanced the Universal Child Care Benefit which now provides families with up
to $1,920/child/year;  We created the Tax-Free Savings Account, which now helps
families save up to $10,000 each year for their future; and  We created the Family
Tax Cut which helps families save up to $2,000/year.

Successes like these are only possible with the generous support of Conservatives
like you.

And while summer may just be starting, you and I know that Labour Day always comes
too soon. By then, there will be just 42 days until the election.  Your support now
is crucial to our victory in October – help us prepare with a $55 donation today.

As a proud father to a postsecondary student, I'm no stranger to the talk about
summer jobs and the question of ""what will I do after graduation?""

The college and university dorms have emptied out for the summer. My son, like so
many other students across Canada, is thinking about finding his place in the job
market.

What will the job market look like? Will there be good jobs? What if I don't find
one?

His anxiety is understandable. Like any parent, I worry about these things too.

Our Conservative government is building a stronger Canadian economy. Since the depths

balanced the budget, and are on track for a budget surplus this year. That's reason

125,20150521,"Fred DeLorey, CPC",It isn’t a joke,"Mike,

I've been saying for a while now that Justin Trudeau just isn't up to the serious job
of Prime Minister. How do I know?

First, he announced his plans for a massive new carbon tax, which will hike taxes and
increase the price of everything – but he didn't tell us how he would pay for it.

Then he announced his Family Tax Hike plan. This will raise taxes and take away every
benefit our Conservative team has delivered for families – but he's hiding a multi-
billion dollar gap in how he'll pay for it.

See the trend? Every time Justin Trudeau brings forward a new scheme, he has no idea
how much it is going to cost or how he will pay for it.

This just goes to show that Justin Trudeau is an economic novice whose only plan for
our economy is higher taxes and pushing us back into deficit.

But his lack of experience and maturity isn't a joke – it's what he wants to bring to
the Prime Minister's office. That's dangerous for our economy and Canadian families.

We can't let Justin Trudeau hurt our economy with his inexperienced, risky schemes –
add your name if you agree that he's just not ready. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc

With only 150 days left, there's still much to be done. Recruiting volunteers,
getting out and meeting the voters, making lawn signs, and securing local campaign
offices are just some of the many things we have left to do.

We've accomplished so much together since 2011. But you and I both know letting
Justin Trudeau form a risky Liberal government will undo all the benefits we've
provided to hard working Canadian families.

Justin Trudeau has already said he will scrap every benefit we've created for
families. This includes income splitting for families and increased Tax-Free Saving
Account limits. And you know the Liberals won't stop there. His plan has a massive
multi-billion dollar hole in it, which could mean an end to income splitting for
seniors and scrapping TFSAs entirely.

It's clear that Justin Trudeau is just not ready for the serious job of Prime
Minister.

October 19th is just around the corner – 150 days away. It's only because of loyal
supporters like you that we'll be able to re-elect Stephen Harper's strong, stable,
Conservative government.

Show us your support for Stephen Harper's proven leadership – add your name today.

government on Canadians – at any cost.

As a proud father of 3, I always look forward to this weekend.

It's a time when I can celebrate the joy of being a dad with my family.

It's also a time to remember why I am proud to be part of our Conservative Party.
We're working hard to provide benefits to all Canadian families – benefits that
Justin Trudeau has promised to take away if he gets the chance.

Help make sure he never gets that chance with a $55 donation to our election
readiness fund! [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]

With Prime Minister Harper, Canadian families are paying $3,400 less in taxes each
year than they were under the Liberals. And the vast majority of the benefits we've
introduced go to low and middle-income families.

As we celebrate Father's Day, I'm proud to say that dads (and moms) can count on
Prime Minister Harper to have their backs – and help them make the best decisions
possible for their kids.

Will you help our Conservative Party continue delivering for families with a small
donation today? [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=c]

Have a wonderful Father's Day,

Tim Uppal

Prime Minister Stephen Harper and our Conservative team have just wrapped up the
sitting of the 41st Parliament - the most productive in decades.

I'm proud to be part of a Conservative Government that has stayed so focused on
Canadians' priorities. We've taken concrete steps to deliver on creating jobs,
keeping taxes low for hard-working families, and protecting Canadians. With Prime
Minister Harper's proven leadership, we:

Kept our promise to deliver a balanced federal budget;  Finished negotiating trade
agreements with 38 countries, including the European Union and South Korea;  Passed
almost 170 bills into law;  Passed 42 Private Members' Bills (almost equal to those
passed in the last five Parliaments combined);  Passed the Anti-terrorism Act 2015,
to help us respond to the evolving threat of jihadi terrorists who are directly
threatening Canadians; and  Passed the Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act,
reaffirming our support for law-abiding hunters, farmers, and sport shooters. And
we've done it all while keeping our communities safe and secure.

We've accomplished a lot together -- but you and I both know there's still so much
more to do.

If you want to help us continue working hard for Canadians,  please contribute a $50
gift to our election readiness fund today. Your contribution will directly assist our
election preparations this summer.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50&vpi=b]

We can't risk all the work we've done. Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair have already
promised to raise taxes and take away many of the benefits we've delivered for
Canadian families.

138,20150627,Cory Hann,Iran and ISIS,"Mike,

On Tuesday, ISIS terrorists drowned, shot, and burned alive three groups of
prisoners.

That same day, Justin Trudeau promised to stop all bombing missions against ISIS in
Iraq and Syria.

When Trudeau was pressed by a reporter on when he'd support military action if he
wouldn't support bombing a terrorist regime as ghastly as ISIS, he called the
question ""nonsensical.""

That's not proven leadership.

Prime Minister Harper knows that ISIS is a genocidal death cult that must be
forcefully opposed. And he has made Canada a leader in the international coalition
against them.

Justin Trudeau has proven once again that he is just not ready to take on the serious
job of leading Canada on the international stage.

Worse, he will undo all the hard work our Conservative Party has done to make Canada
a moral leader in the world.

The world is a dangerous place – and the threat of terrorism is a present reality,
not some future possibility. Justin Trudeau would ease up on terrorists who have
named Canada as a target.

I know this sounds crazy – but click here to see it for yourself.
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/justin-trudeau-on-

Trudeau's just not ready for the serious job of protecting Canadians.

140,20150629,From the Desk of John Walsh,This Time Last Year,"Mike,

About a year ago, I looked over our books at the end of the second quarter of 2014
and was amazed by the results. Our generous supporters contributed an incredible $4.7
million to our election readiness efforts.

Results like that don't happen by chance.

They happen because of the strength and dedication of our grassroots supporters.

Now in 2015, with Election Day just months away, I am again focused on making sure
we're in good shape for the end of the quarter tomorrow.

You see -- like the other political parties -- we are required to publish our
fundraising results each quarter. That means tomorrow is your last chance to donate
before the end of Q2 2015.

Will you donate $55 to help us beat last year's success?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]

We can't do it without your help, and every dollar counts.

The Liberals and NDP have been ramping up their fundraising this month, in an effort
to report impressive numbers ahead of Election Day. Only our loyal donors can help us
do even better than we did in 2014.

We're counting on you today.  Your gift of $55 will go directly towards this goal,
and help our election readiness team prepare for the campaign this fall.

On behalf of the Conservative Party, I would like to wish you and your family a very
happy Canada Day.

Canada's 148th birthday is a joyous time for Canadians from all backgrounds to
celebrate together with friends and family in the July sunshine.

July is also when our increased and expanded Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB)
kicks in.

We're proud to be the only party making life easier for 100% of families with
children. That's exactly what our bigger, better UCCB does – helping families each
year with $1,920/child under 6 and $720/child aged 6-17.

WARNING: These benefits are at risk.

If Justin Trudeau has his way, they'll all disappear, replaced with new tax hikes.

If you agree that these benefits are just too important for families to lose, then
click here to donate $50 today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50&vpi=b] This donation will go
directly towards our election readiness efforts this summer.

Thanks for your support, and I hope you have a fantastic Canada Day!

145,20150707,"Lawrence Toet, MP",Dangerous ideas,"Mike,

Is the NDP policy to be more like Greece?

According to NDP MP Niki Ashton, the answer could very well be yes.

Ashton took to Twitter over the weekend to celebrate the Greek 'no' vote on their
national referendum.

That vote could mean Greece defaulting on billions of dollars of debt and leaving the
Eurozone.

Is that really the economic leadership we need in Canada?

I think we need more of Prime Minister Harper's proven economic leadership.

What has Greece's economic policy led to? Their banks have been closed for over a
week, ATMs are running out of cash, and Greeks can only withdraw 60 Euros/day.

Now, Thomas Mulcair is promising the same high tax, high debt policies that created
the type of chaos we see in Greece today.

Even worse, he attacked Prime Minister Harper in 2012 for refusing to use Canadian
tax dollars to bail out Greece! That's money that would be gone forever if we had let
Thomas Mulcair have his way.

We can't afford to let Thomas Mulcair try to manage a G7 economy with his dangerous
ideas.

The question is: will you support Prime Minister Harper's proven economic leadership?

146,20150708,"Joan Crockatt, MP",A Stampede Treat!,"Mike,

As an unabashed Calgarian, I look forward to the Stampede every year.

Cowboy hats, riding a horse in the parade, country tunes, and beef-on-a-bun - it's
got something for everyone. And of course you can't forget the smell of all the great
barbeque treats sizzling on the grill!

Our family's Stampede tradition includes going to the Grandstand together and (if
we're lucky) a big BBQ at our home. We love firing up the grill with friends and
family.

In celebration of 'The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth,' I wanted to share my
favourite Stampede-time recipe with you. It's always a hit with my family, and I'm
sure it will be a hit with yours too:

Joan's Kicking Horse Chili Recipe

You'll need:

2 packs of lean ground beef  2 large Spanish onions  2 large cans of tomatoes  2
small cans of Hunt's tomato paste  4 jalapeños - or less, if you're afraid!  A
tablespoon of Demerara sugar  A tablespoon of vinegar  2 or 3 (if you like them) cans
of Chili beans  One-third of each:

1 Green pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 1 Red pepper  Olive oil  LOTS of salt, pepper and
cayenne as needed

Preparation:

Sauté onions‎ in olive oil until they are translucent  Feel free to pour a glass of
wine while doing this!  Sauté 2 jalapeños in with the onions  Add ground beef and
cayenne pepper and sauté until brown  Add tomatoes  Puree chili beans in the blender
just for a few rounds and add them to the mix  Add tomato paste  Add vinegar and
sugar  Add the veggies  Add salt and pepper  Add more of anything to taste  Let
simmer for an hour and dig in!

I'll be spending this summer meeting fellow Conservatives in our community ahead of
the election. If I get the chance to meet you, be sure to let me know if you tried
this recipe out at home!

Happy Stampede,

Joan Crockatt

MP, Calgary Centre

As a Conservative, I'm extremely proud of this country. I love Canada for all the
reasons you love Canada. And in recent years, that pride has only grown.

You'll be glad to know that we're not alone. For the fourth time since Prime Minister
Harper formed a majority in 2011, Canada has been recognized for having the world's
best reputation.

The international report praised our ""efficient"" and ""effective government,"" and of
course our ""friendly and welcoming people"".*

I think that's something we can all be proud of.

But Justin Trudeau seems to think otherwise.

Too often we've heard Justin Trudeau criticizing Canada.

He's openly mocked our CF-18s as they joined the international mission combatting the
brutal terrorism of ISIS. He thinks the best and only thing Canada has to offer on
the world stage is winter jackets for refugees.

He's even said ""We shouldn't be so smug about Canada.""**

It's scary to think what would happen to Canada's reputation if Justin Trudeau was
Prime Minister.

Frankly, Justin Trudeau is just not ready to protect Canada's reputation on the world
stage, so we need to run the strongest election campaign possible as we count down to
Election Day.  You can help us stay on track right now by donating $55 to our
election readiness fund.

Your kids, your way.

That's our Conservative Party's motto when it comes to child care.

And we're putting our motto into practice. On July 20, parents across Canada will
start benefitting from our boosted Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB).

Thanks to Prime Minister Harper's proven leadership, every single Canadian family
with a child under 6 will receive $1,920/child per year. Families with kids between 6
and 17 will get $720/child per year.

We're letting you raise your kids your way. Show your support today!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=8d94a7d4&val=55&vpi=b]

Prime Minister Harper is the only leader with a plan to benefit 100% of families with
children.

Justin Trudeau has made it clear that he thinks ""benefitting every single Canadian
family isn't what is fair."" He has already promised to scrap every single benefit our
Conservative Party has introduced to help families.

Thomas Mulcair is no better. His plan is even steeper tax hikes. He may not know what
the current tax rate is, but he's promised to raise it no matter what.

Canadian families deserve better than what Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair are
offering.

We need to reject plans that mean fewer benefits and higher taxes.  Please join me in
supporting Prime Minster Harper's plan to help families raise their kids, their way.

""How do my donations help win the next election?""

As the Party's Executive Director, I'm asked that question fairly often. And it's a
totally understandable question as we prepare for an election less than three months
away.

So a few weeks ago I decided to  ask where YOU would like your donations to go.

I asked because, as one of our loyal supporters, I wanted to hear your priorities.

We had an overwhelming response from our supporters.  When the suggestions were
tallied, we heard – loud and clear – that you wanted to see your dollars going
directly to prepare for the election.

Some of the top-ranked picks were:

Helping bring the campaign tour to your local area  Food and snacks for our
volunteers  Door canvass technology

Sadly, it looks like we missed out on your vote last time. So we're asking supporters
to weigh in once more.

Please let me know what's important to you:  Fill out this quick questionnaire, and
then help us make your priorities a reality. [http://www.conservative.ca/what-are-

As a Conservative, I'm extremely proud of this country. I love Canada for all the
reasons you love Canada. And in recent years, that pride has only grown.

You'll be glad to know that we're not alone. For the fourth time since Prime Minister
Harper formed a majority in 2011, Canada has been recognized for having the world's
best reputation.

The international report praised our ""efficient"" and ""effective government,"" and of
course our ""friendly and welcoming people"".*

I think that's something we can all be proud of.

But Justin Trudeau seems to think otherwise.

Too often we've heard Justin Trudeau criticizing Canada.

He's openly mocked our CF-18s as they joined the international mission combatting the
brutal terrorism of ISIS. He thinks the best and only thing Canada has to offer on
the world stage is winter jackets for refugees.

He's even said ""We shouldn't be so smug about Canada.""**

It's scary to think what would happen to Canada's reputation if Justin Trudeau was
Prime Minister.

stage, so we need to run the strongest election campaign possible as we count down to

Our plan helps hard-working Canadian families hold on to more of their money.

Yet once again, it's under attack from Liberal-friendly third parties.

These secretive, big-dollar groups are so dead-set against our plan to help 100% of
families with children that they are actually spreading misinformation about how the
boosted Universal Child Care Benefit will benefit families.

Let me be very clear:

Under our plan, every single Canadian family with children

will have more money in their bank account.

This is true for every family in every situation -- even after taxes.

Saddest of all is that these groups are deliberately trying to confuse parents and
prevent them from realizing the benefits of our newly-boosted monthly child care
cheques.

As Election Day approaches, more and more Canadians are deciding that Justin just
isn't ready to be Prime Minister.

But what about Thomas J. Mulcair? Most Canadians don't know much - and he wants to
keep it that way.

You and I already know that Thomas Mulcair is just another career politician that
Canadians cannot afford. We know that when he was a Member of the Quebec National
Assembly he was offered an envelope full of cash by a disgraced mayor, and ordered by
a judge to pay $100 grand for defamation. Now, after all that, his party, the NDP,
was caught in a $2.7 million scheme directing taxpayers money to fund their political
offices.

Even worse, if given the chance, his party would wreck our economy.

Now we need to spread that message across Canada – and I'm going to need your help to
do it. As one of the Prime Minister's strongest supporters, I wanted you to get a
sneak peek of our latest TV ads.

163,20150803,Prime Minister Stephen Harper,A serious decision,"Mike,

Earlier today, I met with His Excellency, the Governor General. The 42nd general
election is officially underway. Election Day will be October 19.

This is an election about leadership on the big issues that affect us all: our
economy, and our nation's security.

It is a serious choice between proven, real-world experience and a dangerous approach
that has failed before and is failing in other countries.

As Canadians know, today's global economy remains uncertain. Canada has continued to
perform well compared to other G7 countries, but we cannot lose our focus or veer off
course.

Managing our economy remains our government's top priority. Our choices have been
prudent and our actions have been disciplined. As a result, our economy and our
employment have grown steadily over six years. Our budget is balanced.

Now is not the time for the kinds of hazardous economic schemes that are doing so
much damage elsewhere in the world.

This election is also about our security.

The rise of the so-called Islamic State has fuelled a violent, global jihadist
movement that poses a direct threat to our friends, our allies, and to Canadians. In
Europe, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and ongoing military aggression
continues to threaten the peace and stability won at great price by previous
generations.

Our government has taken decisive action in response to these threats. We are part of
the international coalition against ISIS and at the forefront in the world's response
to Russian aggression.

Now is not the time for political correctness, inexperienced governance or an
ideological unwillingness to act. We must face those who threaten us with moral
clarity, strength, and resolve.

Between now and Election Day, Canadians will make a critical decision about the
direction of our country; a decision with real consequences. A decision about who has
the proven experience today to keep our economy strong and our country safe.

Mike, this will be one of the most important elections our Party has ever fought. But
I know we will win again if we all chip in and work together.  Can I count on you to
do your part with a $55 donation today as we begin our campaign?

It will be a choice between the proven leadership of Stephen Harper and the high-tax,

For Conservatives, it will be 77 days of working harder than we have ever worked
before. The NDP and Liberals are on the attack, and have promised to destroy all the
progress we have made together. We can't let them have that chance.

This election carries serious consequences for Canada. You and I already know that
Justin Trudeau is incapable of managing Canada's $1.9 trillion dollar economy. Since
becoming Liberal leader, he has consistently demonstrated that he is just not ready
for the serious job of being Prime Minister.

And career politician Thomas Mulcair? He and his tax and debt NDP threaten to wreck
our economy and would drive Canada deep into deficit.

As we know all too well, the world is a dangerous place. Jihadi terrorists have
carried out attacks in Canada and now threaten Canadians by name. Justin Trudeau
simply lacks the experience and maturity to deal with these threats at home and
abroad.

Similarly, Thomas Mulcair would end our role in the fight against ISIS and opposes
Canada's role with Ukraine. His dangerous, ideology-driven foreign policy would make
us all less safe.

Your home is more than just a financial asset. It's a place to raise your children,
and to relax with friends and family. But if your home is like mine – it can probably
use a little fixing up!

Well, good news --

Prime Minister Stephen Harper today announced that a re-elected Conservative
government will introduce a new, permanent Home Renovation Tax Credit.

This new Home Renovation Tax Credit will be available each year for substantial home
renovation expenses between $1,000 and $5,000.

Support proven Conservative leadership with a $55 donation today!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]

As Conservatives, we believe that families know best when it comes to spending their
money. That's why the Harper government is focused on cutting taxes and increasing
benefits for Canadians.

With this new, permanent tax credit, it will be more affordable for Canadians to
upgrade their home. It will help families and seniors spend more time with their
loved ones.

But if a Liberal or NDP government gets elected in October, this new tax credit will
NOT happen.

Justin Trudeau doesn't understand how the Home Renovation Tax Credit will support
Canadian families or job creation. In fact, he voted against the Home Renovation Tax
Credit the first time it was introduced by the Harper Government. He simply lacks the
judgement to separate job-killing policies from job-promoting ones.

And Thomas Mulcair and his NDP? They have been against every single tax cut
introduced since 2011. Mulcair's policies are dangerous, and would hike taxes on
hard-working Canadian families.

Only Prime Minister Harper has the proven experience to support Canadian families,

I want to share a couple of numbers that concern me:

80 – In 2014, our government was aware of 80 people who returned to Canada after
engaging in terrorist activities or terrorist training overseas.

130 – The number of people currently believed to be living outside Canada and
supporting terrorist activities overseas.

While our Conservative government has already passed a number of counter-terrorism
measures to better protect Canadians from the threat of terrorism, there is more to
be done.

A re-elected Conservative government will make it illegal to travel to areas like
ISIS-controlled parts of Iraq and Syria, where terrorist groups are engaged in
hostile actions. This will help us stop people who have travelled to these areas from
returning to Canada to commit terrorist acts.

If you support proven Conservative leadership that takes the threat of terrorism
seriously, please let me know here. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/banned-travel-
zones-to-combat-terrorism/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=b0ad5d3a&vpi=b]

I wish I could tell you that these important measures had unanimous support from the
Liberals and NDP.

But the truth is that only Prime Minister Harper and our Conservative Party truly
recognizes the severity of the threat we face from the global jihadist movement.

Justin Trudeau has made it clear that his focus is to restore relations with a brutal
Iranian regime that has called for the destruction of the Jewish people. He's clearly
not ready to represent Canada on the world stage.

And we can't afford to take chances with Thomas Mulcair's dangerous approach to
foreign affairs. His ideologically-driven NDP have voted against every single measure
we've introduced to protect Canadians and would end our role in the fight against
ISIS.

Mike, the truth is that only Prime Minister Stephen Harper and our Conservative Party
can be trusted to take threat of terrorism seriously, and to take the action
necessary to protect Canadians.

Let me know you support Prime Minister Harper's proven leadership against the threat
of jihadist terrorism. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/banned-travel-zones-to-combat-

When it comes to the NDP policy on resource development, can we just call it what it
is?

They oppose it. Each and every time. Plain and simple.

Ultra-left author and NDP candidate Linda McQuaig recently raised eyebrows with
bombshell comments on how an NDP government would destroy Canada's resource sector.

She wants oil sands oil, the heart of Alberta's economy, to ""stay in the ground.""

Help us oppose this dangerous, ideologically-driven plan to ruin our economy with $55
now! [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=c7901610&val=55&vpi=b]

Mike, I don't need to tell you what a disastrous, wrong-headed plan that is.
Abandoning resource development would recklessly kill hundreds of thousands of jobs
at a time when the sector needs stability.

Linda McQuaig's comment is NOT a ""one off"" remark - it comes from the very top.
McQuaig is a star NDP candidate, and Thomas Mulcair has said he would make her a
Cabinet Minister.

And that should scare all of us.

This is just further proof that Canadians cannot afford Mulcair and his dangerous
plans. As Prime Minister Harper recently said, ""there is nothing mainstream about the
NDP on economic policy.""

Help us fight Mulcair's NDP with a $55 donation now.

You know that Prime Minister Stephen Harper and our Conservative government can be
counted on to protect families and children from the threat posed by illegal drugs.

>>Support the Prime Minister's tough stance on illegal drugs today.<<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=8d94a7d4&val=55&vpi=b]

But what you may not know is that Justin Trudeau's Liberals and Thomas Mulcair's NDP
oppose the vital measures we've taken to keep dangerous drugs away from our children,
and to keep heroin injection houses away from our neighbourhoods and schools.

That isn't a point of debate -- it's just a fact.

The Liberals and NDP want to roll back steps we've taken to give parents and local
residents a voice when a heroin injection house wants to move in. And they would
actually expand these injection houses to neighbourhoods like yours, all across
Canada.

But Justin Trudeau's irresponsible views don't stop there.

He refuses to recognize the damage that illegal drugs do to families and communities.
He wants to allow the sale of marijuana in corner stores, a dangerously misguided
policy that would make it easily accessible to our children.

Our Conservative government has a different view. We are focused on keeping drugs OUT
of the hands of children. We will consult and listen to families and residents
whenever a heroin injection house threatens to open in their community.

The bottom line is this: illicit drugs destroy lives. They rob young people of their
futures. They tear families apart, make our streets less safe, and lay waste to our
communities.

Only Prime Minister Harper and a re-elected Conservative government will continue to
combat the use of illegal drugs in our neighbourhoods.  Let us know you support our
efforts to protect Canadian families and children from the dangers of illegal drugs
by making a donation today.

This week the global economy was hit with more troubling news out of China. Stock
markets have been rattled around the world.

Leaders are defined by how they respond to news like this.

But did you hear Justin's reaction? He said he'd work to grow our economy ""from the
heart outwards.""

That's actually his plan to grow and protect Canada's $1.9 trillion dollar economy.

It's not surprising from somebody who thinks ""the budget will balance itself"".

These aren't gaffes or slips of the tongue, they are major warning signs that he
doesn't understand how our economy works. The consequences for our country would be
devastating.

The truth is this: he's an inexperienced politician who's just not ready to manage
Canada's economy in a fragile global context.

With Prime Minister Harper, we've got proven economic leadership and over 1.3 million
net new jobs since the depth of the recession.

We have a budget that didn't ""balance itself"" – it was balanced by the disciplined
and difficult decisions taken by our Prime Minister. And it shows: Canada has the
strongest economic growth in the G7 since 2006.

I want a leader who's serious about the economy, and that means more of Prime
Minister Harper's proven leadership.   Are you with me? Chip in $55 today to help re-

Some offenders are so dangerous, so violent, that we simply can't allow them back on
the streets.

That's why Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced a re-elected Conservative
government will pass ""Life Means Life"" legislation. This will ensure that when the
most heinous criminals get a life sentence, it means a sentence for life.

>>>Agree? Show your support with a donation today<<<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=239f14d3&val=55&vpi=b]

You and I know that only Prime Minister Harper has the proven leadership to deliver
this important legislation. Sadly, Canadians just can't count on the other parties to
keep our streets and communities safe.

Thomas Mulcair's dangerous, ideology-driven criminal justice policy would make our
communities less safe by putting the so-called ""rights"" of criminals ahead of the
rights of victims.

And Justin Trudeau simply doesn't understand the needs and priorities of Canadian
families and communities. He'd allow the sale of marijuana in corner stores, making
it more accessible to our children.

Our opponents will do whatever they can to undermine our party's efforts to improve
safety. They will complain that it is ""too harsh"" on criminals. They will even call
it ""un-Canadian.""

Mike, I know you'll agree with me: It is our responsibility to ensure that the worst
of the worst stay behind bars. Turning a blind eye is NOT the right thing to do!

Time and again, I hear the same thing from small businesses: Cut the red tape.

All across Canada, hours that could be spent training new employees and earning a
living are wasted filling out forms that serve little purpose other than keeping
bureaucrats in Ottawa employed.

Well, small business owners have a friend in the Harper Conservative government.
We've saved businesses over $32 million in administrative burden, as well as over
750,000 hours in time spent dealing with annoying red tape last year alone.

If you support our efforts to cut red tape and make life easier for Canadian
businesses,  support the Prime Minister with a $55 donation today.

Justin Trudeau may think that ""budgets balance themselves"", but small business owners
know better. They know that balancing the books --even for a small business-- takes
hard work and discipline.

They also know that the high-tax plans of Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair will be
disastrous for their livelihood. And if Justin is given a chance to bring in his job-
killing new payroll tax, it will be even worse.

With Prime Minister Harper's proven leadership, we've brought in the biggest tax cuts

successful home business.

Our Economic Action Plan is built on sound public finances and low taxes to create
jobs and grow our economy.

The Prime Minister was in Quebec today, speaking about the economy. He outlined
exactly how our plan is working – and why we need to stick with it so we can keep
taxes low.

With Prime Minister Harper's proven leadership and our Economic Action Plan, Canada
has created over 1.3 million net new jobs since the depth of the global recession.
That makes us a leader in the G7, and the envy of other nations.

In this election, the alternatives offer an almost unthinkable risk.

Justin Trudeau actually believes that budgets somehow balance themselves. Instead of
supporting our plan for families and seniors in these difficult times, he is
promising to strip families and seniors of the programs we have worked hard to
deliver. That means no Universal Child Care Benefit, no income splitting for
families, no TFSA limit increase -- but instead, a massive job-killing payroll tax
hike.

And Thomas Mulcair? His plan to hike taxes and pile on debt will create economic
chaos, putting Canadian workers and small businesses at risk.

If you love the outdoors, you protect it -- for your children and grandchildren.

It's that simple.

Conservatives have always known that hunters, anglers and sports shooters are some of
the strongest conservation advocates around.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper today announced a new suite of measures building on our
government's National Conservation Plan. These commitments will help protect Canada's
natural environment, support economic development, and help us stand up for law-
abiding firearms owners.

>>> Show your support for these vital measures with a donation

to the Conservative Re-election Fund today! <<<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=88e529ed&val=142&vpi=b]

These new measures will create conservation programs to improve habitat for game
animals such as deer, moose, and ducks. They will also provide additional funding to
promote angling, hunting, and snowmobiling tourism in Canada.

Additionally, our Conservative government will work to make sure there are sufficient
firearms safety instructors across Canada. And we remain committed to a permanent end
to the wasteful, ineffective long gun registry.

Above all, we will continue to fight for a common sense approach to gun control which
protects public safety without imposing unnecessary burdens on law-abiding firearms
owners.

But remember, Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair are no friends of law-abiding gun
owners.

They intend to impose new restrictions on lawful firearms owners, and they would
bring back the failed long-gun registry. They would return Canada to the
confrontational policies of the past -- which were not only costly and ineffective,
but actually disrespectful of rural Canadians.

With the proven leadership of Prime Minister Harper, angling, hunting, and
conservation groups can be assured that our conservation efforts will continue to
benefit the environment and our local economies.

Are you with us? Let us know with a contribution of $42, $142, or even $442 today.

186,20150909,Dustin,Helping parents help their kids,"Mike,

For many families, saving for their children's education can be a challenge.

One of the most powerful savings tools for Canadian parents is the Registered
Education Savings Plan (RESP). RESPs help families save in preparation for the costs
of attending post-secondary institutions.

Today, Prime Minister Harper announced that a re-elected Conservative government will
double the federal matching grants provided to low- and middle-income families
through Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs).

That means up to $2,200 more per student. We know low- and middle-income families
work hard to put money aside for their children's future, and we're proud to do more
to help them.

It shouldn't surprise you to learn Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair do not agree
with our approach.

They would rather raise taxes, reduce families' take-home pay and ultimately leave
less money in Canadians' pockets to save for important things like their children's
college or university.

Justin Trudeau doesn't understand the basics of managing a household budget or the
struggle of finding a few extra dollars each paycheque for your child's future.

And Thomas Mulcair? He's made vague promises to support post-secondary education, but
he can't tell you how he will pay for them. It's just one more reason we need to be
worried about his dangerous, high-tax agenda.

Only our Conservative government has a proven record of lowering taxes and balancing
the budget while providing significant support for Canadian families.

And only our government will continue to put money back in the pockets of every
single Canadian family so that they can spend it on their priorities, like saving for
their children's post-secondary education.

Like our plan to help you give your kids a head start with a boost to RESPs? Help us
make it a reality with a small donation today.

Did you know we're already half way through this campaign?

Given this important milestone, I wanted to share an update – and confirm your
support.

Our Prime Minister has been on the road almost every day since August 2. We've
already been to nearly every province and territory, doing as many as five events per
day.

Here's just a few of the new commitments we've made so far:

✔  We will make the popular home renovation tax credit a permanent program

✔  We will increase assistance to low- and middle-income families saving with RESPs

✔  We will reduce red tape for small businesses by 20%, and cut taxes on Canadian
workers by over 20%; and

✔  We will introduce a powerful new tax credit to help employers hire apprentices.

And we'll do it all while maintaining a balanced budget.

>>> Mike, these actions will offer REAL benefits to Canadian families.

Can you help me get the word out with a donation of $60 today? <<<
[http://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=60&vpi=b]

But our opponents have been busy, too.

In Justin Trudeau's case, he's been proving that he's just not ready to lead this
country. He has actually come out in favour of running years of new deficits. His
irresponsible promises will mean more debt and big tax hikes for all of us.

And Thomas Mulcair? He's been busy making massive new spending commitments. He's
promised over $14 billion of new spending in the first year alone -- but he refuses
to say how he's going to pay for it. You and I already know the answer: it will come
from big tax hikes on people like us.

The choice has never been so clear, and Canada needs the proven leadership of Prime
Minister Harper more than ever before.

Mike, I need your help to help get that message out to new voters.  Will you help us
with a donation of $60 today to help us get it done?

188,20150913,Guy Lauzon,Let’s compare...,"Mike,

If you had any doubt that there's only one party who can take Canada's economy
forward, Justin Trudeau just ended it.

In a CBC interview last week, he attacked Canadian small businesses, saying ""a large
percentage"" of them ""are actually just ways for wealthier Canadians to save on their
taxes.""

He's promised to ""tweak"" the taxes of small business owners to collect more revenue
from them. He thinks they're tax scammers, not job creators.

Justin's comments reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how important small
businesses are to our economy. He is just not ready to manage a G7 economy like ours,
especially one where two-thirds of all Canadians are employed by small business!

Our Conservative Party recognizes the importance of small businesses. And we are
committed to helping them grow.

Last week the Prime Minister announced that a re-elected Conservative government will
cut payroll taxes by over 20 percent. 16 million working Canadians will see their
take-home pay increase and small businesses will be able to create new jobs and
invest in their current employees.

Justin has promised the opposite - he wants to hike payroll taxes, taking an extra
$1,000 off the paycheque of a hard-working Canadian making $60,000 per year. That
will hurt small businesses and kill jobs.

Mike, someone who wants to be Prime Minister should support job creators -- not
attack them.  If you agree, let us know with a $60 donation today.

189,20150914,"Guy Giorno, National Campaign Chair",Sneak peek for insiders,"Mike,

The economy is the #1 priority of you, me and most Canadians. Little wonder, given
that the global economy is weak and in turmoil. The Canadian economy is stronger than
other countries' but it is fragile and needs to be protected. Sadly, you don't see
the economy's importance reflected in news media coverage of this campaign.

That's why we are launching a series of new ads, all focused on the economy. That's
the central choice in this election: which government is best to manage and protect
the fragile Canadian economy – and your job – in the face of global economic turmoil?

On October 19, Canadians will choose a government to manage our fragile economy for
the next four years. Amid global economic turmoil, the choice has real consequences.
The wrong government decision on taxes, spending, or deficits can upset our fragile
economy, causing business closures, downsizing and job loss in communities across the
nation.

Our fragile economy is Prime Minister Stephen Harper's number one priority. With a $5
billion surplus so far this year, we're pursuing a low-tax, balanced budget plan to
protect Canadian jobs and growth in the face of global uncertainty.

The Liberals will take the budget that we balanced and have announced they will run
multi-billion dollar deficits. The NDP is promising billions in new spending with no
plan to pay for it. And neither party is able to manage the Canadian economy in the
face of global turmoil. All Canadian families, businesses and communities will feel
the consequences.

Mike, we're about to release some new ads on this topic. Want to see them right now?

190,20150915,Cory Hann,Great news,"Mike,

The numbers are in, and I've got great news.

With Prime Minister Stephen Harper's proven leadership, we've balanced Canada's
budget a year ahead of schedule.

Even better, we're on track to do it again this year… but ONLY if we spend
responsibly, and continue the economic growth that got us here.

Why are we so proud of our balanced budgets? Because they are the foundation of our
plan to protect our economy.

Balanced budgets let us deliver the largest cut to the small business tax rate in
over 25 years. They let us offer a 20% payroll tax cut, which will mean more jobs --
and more money in your pocket.

Balanced budgets also help protect important benefits, like the increased and
expanded Universal Child Care Benefit. They allow us to increase the cap on your Tax-
Free Savings Accounts, an important savings tool used by 10 million Canadians.

With a balanced budget, these things are permanent.

And no one should take them away.

But the Liberals and NDP are threatening to do just that.

They will hike your taxes and plunge us back into deficits. And when they come
looking for more money, they will come after the benefits we've delivered for
families and seniors.

Mike, we can't let them have the chance.

Help Prime Minister Harper protect our economy and all the gains we've made. Your $60
donation today will help bring home the win on October 19.

Families in my riding – and all across Canada – rely on manufacturing jobs to pay
their mortgages and feed their kids.

Our Conservative Party has a plan to protect jobs in manufacturing as part of our
plan for Canada's economy.

Our plan is built on lower taxes, less red tape, and balanced budgets. We will make
sure our manufacturing sector remains globally competitive.

If manufacturing is important to you and your family, you have a clear choice in this
election.

The Liberals want Canada to ""transition away from manufacturing-based employment.""
They are promising big, job-killing tax increases. Their irresponsible approach would
damage the economy and put the jobs of 1.6 million Canadians at risk.

And the NDP? They want to make it unaffordable for Canadian manufacturers to operate
with their massive payroll tax hikes. They would drive manufacturing jobs out of
Canada, and Canadian families would suffer as a result.

These jobs are too important to lose. Only our Conservative Party has a plan to
protect manufacturing jobs, and build up the sector with a new $100 million
investment in manufacturing technology.

and deficits –  chip in $55 today!

But even with Canada's success, the global economy is still weak and unstable. More
than ever, we need a plan to protect Canada's fragile economy and continue our record
of job creation.

That's why a re-elected Conservative government will set a job creation goal of 1.3
million more jobs by 2020.

By sticking to our low-tax, balanced budget plan with Prime Minister Harper and the
Conservatives, this is an achievable target.

The Liberals and NDP have a different plan. They would run permanent deficits, raise
taxes, and kill jobs. We can't let that happen.

198,20150928,Cory Hann,Paul’s interview,"Mike,

Election campaigns have plenty of serious moments ... but there are always lighter
ones, too.

I want to share one of those fun moments with you today.

Last week, Prime Minister Harper announced that a re-elected Conservative government
would purchase the birthplace and early home of former Prime Minister John
Diefenbaker, in Neustadt, Ontario. This way, it can be preserved and commemorated as
a national historic site for all Canadians to enjoy.

He got a special bonus, too. He was interviewed by a true expert in Canadian history,
Paul Grein. Their interview discussed the former Prime Minister, his legacy, and the
house itself.

But why was it was so special? Paul is just eleven years old!

Don't let his age fool you -- he is a bona fide Canadian History whiz.  Check out the
video and see for yourself. [http://cpcp.cc/pTL76C]

It was one of those touching moments on the campaign trail that you don't get to see
every day.

Sincerely,

Cory Hann

Did you watch the Leader's debate?

If so, you saw Prime Minister Stephen Harper proving he is the only leader who can
protect Canada's reputation for principled leadership in the world.

Do you agree? Chip in $55 now to help us win on October 19!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=34a5f522&val=55&vpi=b]

The other two leaders will take us back to the days of playing ""go along to get
along"" with every dictator who has a seat at the UN. Only Prime Minister Harper will
continue Canada's moral leadership on the world stage.

At a time when the global jihadist movement is threatening Canada and Canadians by
name, only our Prime Minister will uphold Canada's active role in the international
coalition against ISIS.

With Russian aggression threatening Ukraine, the Liberals and NDP don't take our
responsibility seriously. Justin Trudeau has even made jokes about it during a TV
interview.

Incredibly, the Liberals have said that they want to reopen negotiations with the
Iranian regime. This is the same regime that has sworn the destruction of Israel, and
has even denied the Holocaust. With Prime Minister Harper, Canada will continue to be
Israel's closest ally.

These differences are a critical reminder of what's at stake on October 19.

Given their dangerous ideas about Canada's role in the world, I can't imagine either
the NDP or the Liberals representing Canada abroad.

Only Prime Minister Harper can protect Canada's reputation on the world stage.

If you agree,  I'm asking you to donate right now to help us win on October 19.

203,20151005,Cory Hann,Tomorrow morning,"Mike,

Tomorrow morning, millions of Canadians will get up and go to work. They will work
hard all week to provide for their families, invest in their kids' future, and to
save for their retirement.

Canada's Conservatives are working to help them do it. With Prime Minister Harper's
leadership, we've cut taxes and increased benefits for families and seniors.

And by cutting payroll taxes by 20%, a re-elected Conservative government will do
even more to help over 16 million working Canadians take home a bigger paycheque.

Prime Minister Harper gets it.

But Justin Trudeau doesn't.

He is promising a job-killing payroll tax hike instead.

Under Justin's plan, those who manage to keep their jobs will find it even harder to
make ends meet: someone earning $60,000 will lose $1,000 off their paycheque!

Justin Trudeau is also planning to make life harder for families by stripping away
every single benefit our Conservative government has brought in, including the
Universal Child Care Benefit and income splitting.

What's more, his permanent, multi-billion dollar deficits will mean taxes will have
to go up even more. That's going to hurt Canadian workers, families, and seniors.

Justin Trudeau is just not ready for the serious job of managing our economy – in
fact, his ideas will end up hurting Canadian families.

There are just 15 days to go.

Help us stop him with a $55 donation today!

204,20151006,Dustin van Vugt,800 million new customers,"Mike,

I have great news: We have concluded negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
the largest free trade agreement in history.

This agreement will give Canadian businesses nearly tariff-free access to 800 million
new customers in 11 countries.

Our participation in the TPP will create new, well-paying jobs. It will grow every
sector of our economy by giving Canadian businesses access to some of the fastest-
growing new markets in the world.

Canada will now be the only G7 nation with free trade access in the US, the Americas,
Europe, and Asia – that's over 60% of the world's economy.

That's a lot of great news, but you probably have some questions:

The Prime Minister will be taking your questions on the trade agreement on Facebook
at 7:15pm Eastern Time this evening.  You can post your questions on his Facebook
page right now. [https://www.facebook.com/pmharper/posts/10153555428947110]

How would the Liberals and NDP have handled an agreement like this?

The Liberals claim to support free trade, but they have almost no record of getting
the job done.

And the NDP? They are showing their true colours by vowing to rip up the deal and the
Canadian jobs it will create.

When our Conservative government came to power, Canada had free trade agreements with
only 5 countries. Thanks to Prime Minister Harper's leadership, we now have deals
with 51 countries, representing over half of the global economy.

Only Prime Minister Harper and our Conservative government are committed to
protecting our economy and creating jobs by opening up new markets to Canadian goods
and services.

It locks in your vote. No matter what happens on Election Day, your vote is already

With Prime Minister Harper, Canada has a plan to protect our fragile economy based on
lower taxes, balanced budgets, and a plan to create 1.3 million new, well-paying jobs
for Canadians.

But an NDP or Liberal government would mean a return to tax hikes and big deficits.
The Liberals are promising to take over $1,000 more off the paycheque of a typical
hardworking Canadian. And the NDP's tax hikes would mean over 250,000 jobs lost
across Canada.

As Canadians, we have so much to be thankful for. At the top of my list: We live in
the best, and most admired, country in the world.

Because Thanksgiving weekend is a special time for families, I wanted to mention just
a few of our Conservative commitments to make life a little easier for Canadian
parents and families.

In this election, we have committed to:

Extending parental leave to 18 months, and letting parents choose to stretch their EI
benefits over a year and a half;  Giving parents the ability to earn income while on
leave without affecting their EI benefits;  Protecting the enhanced Universal Child
Care Benefit that helps EVERY SINGLE Canadian family with kids; and  Ensuring that
income splitting for families remains in place, and safe from the Liberal and NDP
plans to scrap it.   All these benefits start from a simple principle: that the real
child care experts are moms and dads. We've focused on helping parents hold on to
more of their money, so they can make the choices that are right for their own
family.

Mike, the family benefits announced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper will help all
Canadians -- your family, your neighbours. That's why we need to protect them by re-
electing a Conservative government.

Over 850,000 Canadians have already cast their ballot in the advance polls. Will you
join them?

Polls are open today and tomorrow, from noon to 8pm.  Commit to voting today.

215,20151016,Cory Hann,They can’t pay for it all,"Mike,

The numbers don't lie: Justin Trudeau's high taxes and big spending would lead to
permanent deficits and job losses. The result? Serious economic pain for families
like yours.

So far this campaign, Justin Trudeau has promised to cancel income-splitting, and to
impose a $1,000 payroll tax hike on the typical Canadian worker. He has also promised
to scrap your Universal Child Care Benefit cheques, and to claw back expanded Tax-
Free Savings Accounts that help 11 million Canadians save for their future.

But even with all the money he'd take from Canadians, it still won't be enough to pay
for his unaffordable promises! So, in addition to raising taxes, he will also run
massive, permanent deficits.

Add it all up, and the Liberals' reckless promises would increase government spending
by $146.5 billion. And guess what? Canadian families (like yours!) would be stuck
paying the bill.

Mike, we can't let that happen. With just 4 days to go, I need your help to fight
back. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=220b1eb5&val=55&vpi=b]

While the Liberals double down on a high-tax, high-debt agenda that has failed in
other countries around the world, our Conservative Party refuses to raise taxes or
cut back the benefits that families rely on. We have a better plan, one that will
keep taxes low and create new, well-paying jobs.

Mike,

In just 3 days, your vote will help decide the direction of our country.

If supporters like you don't vote, allowing the Liberals or NDP to win, then what
happens?

For one, it means job-killing tax hikes and massive, permanent deficits would become
the new reality. Our plan to protect our fragile economy would be tossed aside.

Instead, the Liberals and NDP would destabilize Canada's economy with a high-tax,
high-debt agenda that has failed elsewhere in the world. Your job could be on the
line.

I don't want that, and I know you don't either.

Commit to vote here [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/commit-to-

Mike,

What kind of decision do we face?

It's very serious choice between our Conservative Party and the tax-hiking Liberals
and NDP.

The Liberals have promised permanent, multi-billion dollar deficits and massive tax
hikes. Even worse, the NDP's tax hikes will kill an estimated 250,000 jobs across
Canada!

Their promises would expose our fragile economy to the economic chaos elsewhere in
the world.

And it's all at stake on Election Day, just two days away.

The choice is clear – It's Prime Minister Harper, or the Liberals and the NDP.  And
your vote will make a difference.

Our Conservative Party has a plan to protect our fragile economy. It's a plan built
on low taxes, balanced budgets, and a plan to create 1.3 million more Canadian jobs

But the Liberals and NDP have different priorities. They will undo our hard work,
raising payroll taxes and running massive, permanent deficits. Their promises would

It all comes down to today.

Your vote will decide who will manage Canada's economy for the next four years, and
whether our tax bills are higher, or lower.

The stakes are high. Every single vote is going to count.

On the one hand is Justin Trudeau and the Liberals, with their job-killing tax hikes.

Make no mistake, their plans to hike taxes and spend money we don't have will mean
fewer jobs and lower paycheques for those who do have jobs. That's the wrong
direction for the hard-working families of this country.

On the other hand is our Conservative plan to cut taxes, create 1.3 million jobs and
protect our fragile economy.

That's the choice: higher taxes under the Liberals or lower taxes with the
Conservatives.

I'm asking for your support to cut taxes and protect our economy.

Thank you,

Mike,

I have one question for you:  Who is best able to manage Canada's two trillion dollar
economy?

I've watched my husband work very hard to cut taxes to do what's right for our great
country.

We've stayed focused on helping hard-working families get ahead, supporting seniors,
and keeping the Canadian economy moving forward.

We're on track for our second balanced budget in a row.

Taxes have gone down.

There are 1.3 million more Canadians working than there were at the depth of the
global recession.

But the Liberals are proposing to hike taxes and run deficits. These Liberal tax
hikes will cost Canadian families, businesses, workers, and seniors.

So we have a choice: higher taxes with the Liberals or lower taxes with the
Conservatives.

If you agree that we need to protect our economy and keep taxes down, then I need you
to take the time to vote for your local Conservative candidate.

Thank you,

Laureen

Conservatives know that free trade is good for Canada.

During our time in office, we concluded free trade negotiations with more than 40
countries. Now, as Canada's Official Opposition, we will continue to fight for
expanded free trade.

Earlier this year our Conservative team, led by Minister Ed Fast, concluded
negotiations on the most important free trade deal since NAFTA – the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, or TPP.

This deal is a good deal. It will mean good Canadian jobs, and it will grow our
economy.

Our allies already support this deal. Canada should ratify the TPP agreement, so we
can begin to reap the benefits.

BUT…

But Justin Trudeau still refuses to say he will support the TPP.

His silence on the issue is deafening. President Obama, after his meeting with
Trudeau, even went so far as to declare that Canada would sign the deal.  Who's
actually speaking for Canada?

Justin Trudeau's lack of leadership on this vital trade deal is deeply concerning.

Canada's finances are too important.  We will continue to closely watch their
spending, and we will call them out for trying to recklessly plunge Canada back into
the red.

I'm going to be blunt: this is what we're going to be up against for the next four
years.

We will fight tirelessly for accountability and transparency -- but we're going to
need your help.  Do your part with a $55 donation today

236,20151204,Karen Vecchio,Does this make sense to you?,"Mike,

Before the campaign started, Justin Trudeau told Canada that ""wealthy families...like
mine"" didn't need the government to help pay for their childcare.

He even went as far as to say that he'd donate his monthly childcare cheques to
charity.

But apparently something changed after the election.

Now, Justin Trudeau is using taxpayer dollars to pay for the very same nannies he
previously paid for personally.

>>>DONATE NOW TO HELP US FIGHT LIBERAL HYPOCRISY!<<<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]

Why does Justin Trudeau (who is paid over $320,000 per year) think it's okay to stick
taxpayers with his childcare bill? Especially when he's pledged to take childcare
support away from thousands of Canadians who make less than he does?

This is the kind of hypocrisy we're going to have to fight against for the next four
years - one set of rules for Liberals, and another for everyone else.

Conservatives brought in a plan that benefits EVERY SINGLE Canadian family. We will
continue to fight for hard-working Canadians, not well-connected Liberal insiders.

Today is an exciting day.

It's the first day of the new Parliament -- and the first day our Conservative caucus
will take on Justin Trudeau's Liberals.

We're ready to ask the tough, challenging questions that will hold the Liberals to
account. Will you help us get started on the right foot with a small donation today?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=55&vpi=b]

He hasn't even been Prime Minister for a month, but there are already lots of
questions that Justin Trudeau needs to answer:

Why don't the Liberals recognize the valuable role our CF-18s play in the fight
against ISIS?  Why does the Prime Minister think it's okay to shift his childcare
costs to taxpayers, while stripping thousands of Canadian families of their childcare
cheques?  Why are the Liberals' deficit projections so different from those of the
Parliamentary Budget Officer?

Canadians deserve answers – and Conservatives are focused on getting them.

Your support is critical to helping your Conservative team in Ottawa get the job
done.  Chip in today to help us fight for the truth!

access to their Cabinet Ministers.

(Ticked off?  Help us fight it with a quick donation
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50&vpi=b])

First, they offered up a chance to win a ticket to the Liberal Caucus Christmas

chip in some money to the Liberals.

But that's not the worst of it.

Next, the Liberals ran a contest to win a home visit from the Minister of Finance (in
exchange for a donation, of course). This was so bad, the Ethics Commissioner stepped
in and shut it down.

They're stomping on the Parliamentary Ethics Rules meant to protect Canadians ...

240,20151211,Tony Clement,Canada is backing away,"Mike,

Canada isn't back, Canada is backing away.

Canadian CF-18s have flown missions in Iraq and Syria for over 14 months. During that
time, they have dropped over 500 bombs on ISIS training camps, fighting positions,
bomb factories, weapons caches, and equipment.

And, unless we do something, that will stop in a matter of weeks.

Let Justin Trudeau know you think we should stand by our allies!
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/support-our-
allies/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=b0ad5d3a&vpi=b]

While our allies around the world are increasing their efforts, Justin Trudeau
refuses to recognize the valuable role our fighters play in the international
coalition against ISIS.

The Liberals are alone in their views.

The US, Britain, and France are worried our withdrawal could undermine efforts to
contain ISIS. Over two-thirds of Canadians support the bombing missions (nearly twice
the number of people who voted Liberal).

And yet, Justin Trudeau is going to end our role in the fight against ISIS without
Parliamentary debate, without a vote, and with as little noise as possible, hoping
that you don't notice he's putting Canada in retreat.

Well, we're not going to let him get away with it.

We're introducing a motion to force a debate on the issue. If Justin Trudeau is going
to force through actions that Canadians disagree with, we're going to make him
explain himself.

And you can help.

Let us know you think Canada should stand with our allies,

I know 2019 seems a long way off -- I'm not looking forward to four years of Justin
Trudeau, either!

But it is very important for Conservatives across Canada to seize the opportunity
we've been given to build and strengthen our Party today.

In the coming years, we'll be electing a new leader and building a strong team to
support them.

We'll be talking to members and supporters like you to create the plan we will bring
to Canadians in the election.

And we'll be building up our war chest to combat the tricks and attacks the Liberals
continue to bring against us.

Want to be a part of this?  One of the very best ways to help is by signing up for a
monthly donation plan.
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&m=true&val=35&vpi=c]

This provides our Party with a steady source of revenue, and simplifies the donation
process for you.

And at the end of a year, you get a tax credit for the full value of your annual
donations.*

I'm looking forward to growing our Conservative Party over the next four years, and I
hope I can count on you to be a part of it.

We're in it for the long haul, Mike. Are you with us?

Important news: Justin Trudeau's Liberals are sneakily rolling back ground-breaking

Over the past few days, Trudeau's Liberals scrapped rules that let First Nations
people know how much their Chiefs take home, as well as rules that required unions to
tell their members how their dues were being spent.

backs with a donation today!<<<

The Liberals know what they're doing is unpopular. Why else would they wait until the
middle of the Christmas season to change these rules? They just don't want you to
know!

Justin Trudeau just proved that he is ""all talk and no action"" on improving
government transparency. That's why our Conservative team is doing what needs to be
done to fight them as they try to water down these new rules.

Our Conservative team brought in these transparency rules. The Liberals quietly
scrapped them. Whose side are you on?

2015 is wrapping up. And while many people like to look backwards to reflect upon
their year – I want to stay focused on what's ahead of us.

Why?

It's simple. We've got a big year ahead of us in 2016.

Without a doubt, it will be one of the most significant years our young party has
ever faced:

Our MPs will be fighting hard against Liberal tax hikes and schemes for a bigger,
more intrusive federal government;  We'll have a vibrant National Convention in
beautiful Vancouver at the end of May; and  We'll see the earliest phases of our
first leadership race since we first formed the Conservative Party back in 2003.

All year, we'll be working hard to build and renew as we look to the future and
prepare for the next campaigns we'll face together.

It's a lot to accomplish, but I know we can get it done with your help, Mike.

253,20151230,"Scott Reid, MP",BREAKING NEWS: Liberals rule out referendum!,"Hello Mike,

I apologize for interrupting your holidays, but someone's trying to take advantage of
you as you spend time with your family and loved ones.

You see, Justin Trudeau's Liberals announced yesterday that you will NOT have a say
in the process of electoral reform. That's right: there will be no referendum.

We're going to fight this tooth and nail -- but we need your help.

Will you donate to our Referendum Fund, to help us fight for your right to a
democratic voice before the Liberals change the face of Canadian democracy forever?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/tax-credit?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50&vpi=b]

Why would the Liberals sneakily reveal this important detail just two days after
Christmas?

Well, it's certainly not because they want you to pay attention.

No, this was a cynical move made by a government that knows they're acting against
the wishes of the Canadian people. They know they can't win a referendum, so they're
going to unilaterally ram through the biggest change to Canadian democracy since our
country was founded.

Worse, they're only doing it because they know it will virtually guarantee them a
never-ending Liberal government.

If you want your voice to be heard, help us fight for a referendum. Help us reach out
to Canadians from coast to coast to coast as we mobilize and force this government to
be accountable to the Canadian people.

Donate to our Referendum Fund, and let's make sure our democracy isn't changed
forever just because Justin Trudeau said so. [https://donate.conservative.ca/tax-

think --- but he has already decided that YOU won't get a say in the matter.  That
can't stand. Help us force their hand with a donation to our Referendum Fund now.

Taking on the Liberals will be a tough fight.

We're already gearing up for a big fight. The Liberals are trying to completely
change how we vote without getting the approval of voters. We're standing up against
their unilateral moves and demanding a referendum.

We know we need to fight for hard-working Canadians all across our great country.
People who --like you-- just want to hang on to more of their money with lower taxes,
and to know that their government is being held accountable.

Justin Trudeau wants to completely change the face of Canadian democracy – without
even bothering to ask what Canadians think.

He is promising to move ahead with his plans to fundamentally change our electoral
system, but has refused to give Canadians a say by referendum.

Let me know you oppose this undemocratic plan to change our democracy!

Justin Trudeau knows that Canadians don't want risky, radical changes to how we vote.
And that is exactly why he won't put it to a referendum.

Instead, he'd rather ram through the biggest change to our democracy since
Confederation without properly consulting with Canadians.

His proposed changes would make it virtually impossible to kick the Liberals out of
office.

If Canadians truly want to change our system of democracy, we need to hear it
directly from voters – not Justin Trudeau and his Liberals.

Payroll taxes, carbon taxes, income taxes. They're all going up.

We already know they've backed down on their target of $10-billion deficits, which
means even more taxes in the years to come.

Conservatives know that high taxes make life harder for Canadians – for people like
you. It cuts into your paycheque, puts jobs at risk, and makes life harder for
families and seniors.

support low taxes.  Let us know you do as well. [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc

By now, you've probably heard that Canada was not invited to a meeting of the allied
nations working together to stop ISIS.

Six months ago, Canada hosted a meeting like this.

The only thing that's changed since is Justin Trudeau and his promise to abandon our
allies in the international coalition against ISIS.

This is without doubt Justin Trudeau's biggest failure on the world stage to date… so
far.

>>Let us know you agree that Canada should stand by our allies in the fight against
ISIS.<< [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/support-our-allies/?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=b]

Justin Trudeau keeps making vague references to participating - he can't explain why
bombing ISIS is good, but bad for Canada.

Behind all of his talk lies a simple fact:

Canada is no longer mentioned among the list of countries who are stepping up in the
fight against this genocidal terrorist group.

Our allies in the coalition and the people on the ground don't need Trudeau's empty
words. They need our support in the skies.

Our MPs are in Parliament as we speak, fighting for your values, protecting your
paycheque, and standing up for your liberties.

And Justin Trudeau? He's got a busy schedule ahead of him this year:

He's already abandoning our allies in the fight against ISIS.  He's going to hike the
taxes you pay today, and bring in new taxes on top of them; and  He's going to take a
lot of selfies.

But there's more -- he's trying to force through massive changes to the way you vote
(without asking you first).

Canada's Conservatives know that Canadian jets are an important contributor to the
fight against ISIS. We know that increasing taxes is not the way to greater
prosperity.  And we join the millions who know that Canadians must have their say in
a referendum before forcing massive changes to Canadian democracy.

It won't always be easy, but we are going to fight for you each day.

Show your support for Canada's Conservatives – share this on Facebook:

I know we'll make you proud.

Gord Brown

273,20160129,Tony Clement,Iran and Russia?,"Mike,

I was proud to be part of a Conservative government that stood up to aggressive thugs
and oppressive regimes.

When countries like Russia and Iran invaded other countries and sponsored terrorists,
Canada's Conservatives took a principled stance with our allies, and brought in
sanctions. We were a strong voice in the world, supporting freedom, democracy, and
human rights.

But Justin Trudeau is changing all that.

He is removing sanctions against the Iranian regime, a state sponsor of terror hell-
bent on the destruction of Israel.

Justin Trudeau is even ""normalizing"" relationships with Russia, while they are
invading Ukraine!

>>Iran and Russia or Ukraine and Israel -- Let me know whose side you're on<<
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/where-do-you-
stand/?mpi=[campaignid]&sig=f18e06bb&vpi=b]

What message does that send to our allies? That Canada is willing to overlook
military action against our friends? That we no longer care about human rights abuses
against women and religious minorities?

Justin Trudeau has abandoned the strong, principled role that Canada played in the
world under our Conservative government. He's gone back to the days of going along to
get along with every thug and tyrant who has a seat at the United Nations.

If you haven't yet heard, the Liberals have made a choice between Iran and Israel.

The Liberals announced today that they're dropping most of our sanctions against the
government of Iran, a state sponsor of terror.

Instead of standing by our closest ally, Israel, Justin Trudeau is choosing to
support a government that denies the Holocaust and continues to call for the
eradication of the Jewish people and the country of Israel.

But it's worse than that.

There are families here in Canada who are in the process of suing Iran as state
sponsors of terror. They're trying to get justice for acts of terrorism supported or
funded by the Iranian state.

By embracing Iran, Justin Trudeau has made their cases virtually impossible to fight.

This is the new Liberal foreign policy. Rejecting our allies and rewarding a
government who calls for genocide.

This is wrong and I'm going to fight it.

100 days – that's how long Justin Trudeau has been in the Prime Minister's office.

What has he accomplished in that time?

Well, for starters, today he finally admitted his budget will exceed $10-billion in
deficit - despite their promise to Canadians.

He's raised taxes. He's backed down from the fight against ISIS and reduced sanctions
against Iran. He's even taken our balanced budget and pushed it way into deficit -
which could reach $90 BILLION dollars, according to The National Bank.

Our Conservative team has been working hard to hold this government to account -
others might give them a free ride on their failures - we won't.

Our Conservative Party isn't going to let him get away with this.

We are committed to holding Trudeau and his Liberals to account, even if we're the
only ones doing it. But we need your help to get it done.

Next week we will be back in the House. We'll be continuing to stand up to his bad
decisions and even worse policies.

But our ability to get this job done is only as good as the support we have from
grassroots supporters like you, Mike.

You may have missed this a few weeks back, but Justin Trudeau's Liberal campaign and
the big union bosses have had some suspicious dealings.

It was revealed that the big union bosses paid union members to be props at Liberal
campaign events – a direct violation of the Elections Canada rules against political
donations by unions and businesses.

On the very same day, the Liberals announced that they were going to scrap
Conservative legislation to increase transparency and accountability to help union
members.

Help us fight for transparency and accountability!  Sign our petition today!
[http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/you-scratch-my-back-ill-scratch-
yours/?mpi=[campaignid]&vpi=b]

Why doesn't Justin Trudeau believe that union members deserve to know how their dues
are being spent, or that union votes should be held by secret ballots? At the same
time we're finding out union bosses used union funds to donate to the Liberal
campaign, Trudeau is repealing Conservative laws that would have helped prevent this.

Conservatives know that transparency and accountability are important. That's why our
first piece of legislation as a government was the Accountability Act. It's why we
improved accountability for First Nations and for unions.

But the Liberals have already started to roll back these vital measures, making it
harder for Canadians to find out how their money is being spent.

If you agree that Justin Trudeau should put ordinary Canadians ahead of the big union
bosses, add your name to let us know! [http://www.conservative.ca/cpc/you-scratch-my-

Deficits would be no more than $10 billion per year for three years.  He would
balance the budget by 2019.  The debt-to-GDP ratio would go down every year.

It's only been four months since the election, and he's already broken every single
one of those promises.

We're already hearing that this Liberal budget could add over $30 billion to the

Wow – last night, Premier Brad Wall and his Saskatchewan Party won their third
straight mandate, garnering 62.5% of the vote!

This is just the latest conservative win in Canada. Last month, Ontario Progressive
Conservative candidate Lorne Coe won the Whitby-Oshawa by-election – with a whopping
53% of the vote.

Conservative momentum is already building again in Canada.

Conservatives in Saskatchewan and Ontario handily defeated the NDP and the Trudeau-
Wynne Liberals.

That's because conservative ideas – both big-C and small-c – are good for Canada.

291,20160415,Jaime Girard,Open and transparent... ?,"Dear Mike,

Last week, the Parliamentary Budget Officer put out a report. It is a damning review
of Trudeau's first six months in office.

The report details how the Liberals have completely failed on budgeting,
transparency, openness, and economic forecasts.

>> Help us fill our 2019 war chest – donate $50 now. <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/default/PU3B0F?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

The report concluded that:

The Liberals over-estimated the number of jobs their measures would create;  The
Liberals have not been transparent in their reporting of Canada's finances; and  The
Liberals have refused to provide supporting documentation for their forecasts!

And that last point's significance should not be lost – after campaigning on a
promise to be open and transparent, this report shows the Liberals have been anything
but.

Frankly, this is a question of competency.

And that should deeply concern everyone. There isn't enough information in the
Liberal's budget to know whether the government is spending tax dollars properly.

The fight to replace the Liberals and bring competence back to Ottawa begins NOW.
Will you help us fill our war chest to beat the Liberals in 2019?

Earlier this week, my colleagues and I came to a realization of what this Liberal
government is beginning to remind us of: kids with their parents' credit card.

The Liberals promised that they'd be careful with Canada's finances, they'd only buy
things we needed, and would spend ""modestly"". Of course, they have done the opposite
of all of that.

It's a lot like kids going to the grocery store with their parents' credit card. They
didn't just go out and buy the essentials they were sent for – they came back with
the best candy and junk food someone else's money could buy.

Like those kids, the Liberals just don't seem to get that someone has to pay for
their frivolous spending . And now we're left with the stomach ache.

Only all Canadians are the unwitting parents stuck with the bill!

Justin Trudeau told us he'd only spend us into a $10 billion deficit. Canadians
trusted him and handed over the credit card. Now we're left with a bill that leaves
us $30 billion in the red, and no plan to pay it back.

Why does Justin have no plan? Because it's not his money, so it's not his concern.

see her as an MP, not as the highest lawyer in the land.

will hurt every Canadian family looking for help with kids sports costs. Summer
baseball and soccer practices are just around the corner, and I'm at a loss on why

Last week, we sent out an email comparing the last Conservative budget and Justin
Trudeau's first budget.

Our budget was balanced and lowered taxes for Canadians. Justin Trudeau's budget
racked up billions in deficit spending and canceled our tax breaks.

This isn't just about two different budgets, but about two very different approaches
to governing.

Help us fight for LOWER taxes – donate $50 now! [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-
put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

Our Conservative government put Canadian families first. We brought in income
splitting for families, introduced children's fitness tax credits, and lowered the
GST – twice. We ensured that Canadians got to keep more of the money they earned.

The Liberals take a very different approach.

The Liberals immediately canceled our tax breaks for families. After promising
""modest"" deficits of ""only"" $10 billion per year, it was quickly revealed that the
Liberal deficits would total at least $30 billion per year.

Since governments only get money from one place – your wallet - massive deficits such
as this can only lead to one thing: higher taxes.

That's the difference between Conservatives and Justin Trudeau's Liberals. We believe
that Canadians know how to spend their money best, while the Liberals believe they
know how to spend your money better than you do.

That is why Conservative governments ensure you get to keep more of your money, while
the Liberals take more of your money and spend it for you.

We will continue fighting for lower taxes and responsible government – but we need
your help.  Donate $50 now and help us keep pressure on the Liberals.

301,20160429,Rona Ambrose,Stephen Harper was right.,"Dear Mike,

Over the last couple weeks, I have been thinking about an event that happened during
the last campaign.

You might remember. At a campaign stop in Hamilton, Stephen Harper mocked Justin
Trudeau's plan to run only ""modest"" deficits.

He pointed out that these ""modest"" deficits would inevitably get bigger and lead to
higher taxes on Canadians.

The political elite jumped to Trudeau's defence, and the internet jokes came fast and
furious.

But Stephen Harper was absolutely right.

After the election, it only took a few months for Canadians to learn that Justin
Trudeau's promised ""modest"" $10 billion deficit had ballooned to $30 billion. The
Liberals also moved quickly to scrap our tax breaks for families – including income
splitting, and children's arts and fitness tax credits – and clawing back the Tax-
Free Savings Account increase.

Many Trudeau supporters like to point out that we also ran deficits when we were in
power.

The difference they don't tell you about, of course, is that our deficits were in
response to a collapse in the global economy on the scale that we had not seen in
over 80 years. In 2008-2009, not only did economic activity plummet, but the global
financial system froze up as major institutions collapsed.

At that point, governments around the world realized that action was necessary to
speed up investments in infrastructure and to help restore confidence in global
markets.

So we responded by running a temporary deficit. And it worked. Throughout the
recession, Canada performed very well, and we maintained the strongest financial
system in the world.

And, as promised, we restrained spending as the economy recovered and in early 2015
we were able to balance the budget.

Justin Trudeau's deficits, on the other hand, are completely unnecessary.

There is no worldwide recession as there was in 2008-2009. Justin Trudeau is
needlessly plunging Canada further into debt to pay for his election promises. And he
has no plan to pay it back.

During the last election, Stephen Harper also rightly pointed out that the ""small""
deficits run by Pierre Trudeau in the early 1970s became big deficits that went on
for over a generation. Those deficits only ended when the Liberals dramatically hiked
taxes and made deep cuts to health care and education in the 1990s.

And that, Mike, is why it is so important to only run deficits when it is absolutely
necessary, and to have a plan to responsibly eliminate them as soon as possible.

Justin Trudeau is not just harmlessly racking up a bit of borrowing - he is saddling
our children, and possibly even their children, with billions of dollars in debt.
After all, as we all know, borrowed money needs to be paid back.

The next election is still some time away. But you can count on Canada's
Conservatives to fight for you and your family every single day.

Every dollar we raise helps us get our message in front of more Canadians – please
help us fight for lower taxes and responsible government with a $50 donation today.

44-member entourage made up of celebrities, his children's nannies, and his in-laws.

That's right, his in-laws.

Rather than bringing along his Natural Resources Minister to, you know, advocate on
behalf of Canadian jobs, Justin Trudeau decided to include his mom, his in-laws, and
top Liberal fundraisers on the trip.

His priority wasn't you, or to negotiate for pipelines that would benefit hard-
working Canadians, he preferred a photo op with the President that benefited his
family, friends and the Liberal Party.

Can you pitch in $50 to remind the Prime Minister that he should stop taking selfies
and stand up for Canadian jobs? [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-

308,20160515,Scott Reid,Canadians need the final say!,"Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau wants to change the way Canadians elect their MPs.  So he made sure to
put the fix in now. He created a committee made up of 60% Liberals to determine the
best way forward...for the Liberals!

Because Trudeau promised to do away with First Past The Post, he is now acting as if
he has a mandate to implement whatever system his Liberal-dominated committee comes
up with!

309,20160519,Rona Ambrose,Moving Canada forward,"Dear Mike,

There have been some amazing things happening all across Canada lately. Over the last
few months I have been lucky enough to have traveled all across our great country,
and I wanted to share some of the experiences with you.

Last month, conservative-minded parties won two provincial elections in Saskatchewan
and Manitoba, with significant margins of victory. In Saskatchewan, Brad Wall and his
conservative Saskatchewan Party were re-elected with a whopping 62.5% of the vote!

In Manitoba, Brian Pallister's Progressive Conservative Party took office with a
historic 40 seat majority government!

Our victories are not limited to the Prairies. Just a few months ago, Patrick Brown's
Progressive Conservative Party handily won against the Kathleen Wynne Liberals in a
contentious by-election in Whitby-Oshawa – despite a ""high-profile"" campaign stop
from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. While very unusual for a Prime Minister to insert
themselves in a provincial by-election, the conservative candidate, Lorne Coe, still
won with 53% of the vote!

Mike, the conservative movement is stronger than ever in Canada with these victories
and I look forward to seeing similar successes in future provincial elections.

Even in the face of tragedy, I have seen Canadians come together in unprecedented
ways. The fire in Fort McMurray, though devastating, demonstrated the generosity of
this country. People from across the country have donated $60 million for the Red
Cross - a new record for Canada! And warehouses are stocked full of donated goods
that came in from across the country.

How great is it that in the wake of a devastating natural disaster, we actually have
too many donated goods for the victims?

In a little over a week we will be meeting in Vancouver for our convention. This will
be a great opportunity for Canadian conservatives to come together and present new
ideas and visions for our party. With the upcoming leadership race, I cannot wait to
see what our members have to say!

If you cannot make it to the convention, can you help us move Canada forward with a
donation of $50? [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-

incoherence on why they are refusing to let Canadians decide on this important issue.

Summer is here! As always, many Canadians will use the summer as an opportunity to
visit other parts of this great beautiful country of ours.

Maybe they'll visit the Okanagan wine region here in British Columbia, sample the
delicious craft brews in Nova Scotia, or check out what other regions offer anywhere
in between. Of course, they will want to bring some of that home to share with family
and friends.

But did you know it's still illegal in many jurisdictions to move alcohol across
provincial borders?

Conservatives know Canadians want to buy Canadian - which is why we made changes in
the last Parliament to get government out of the way. But many provinces continue to
stonewall with horrendously outdated laws that restrict the freedom of Canadians, and
that hurts Canadian beer and wine manufacturers.

Did you also know that right now it is easier for a winery in BC to directly sell
into Asia than it is to sell in Ontario?

This needs to end, and our Conservative Party wants to 'Free Our Beer', by opening up
our internal economy for all Canadian producers of other products!

that there were always opportunities for me as a conservative woman.

I'm proud of the fact that not only are we the only federal party with a female
leader (who got there based on merit, not by quota), Conservatives have also paved
the way for other firsts in Canada:

The first female cabinet minister and the first woman to serve as acting Prime
Minister, Ellen Fairclough, was a Conservative;  Canada's first female foreign
minister, Flora MacDonald was a Conservative;  The first woman to lead the Official
Opposition, Deb Grey, was a Conservative; and  Canada's first female Prime Minister,
the Right Honourable Kim Campbell, was a Conservative!

Unfortunately, columnists like Heather Mallick choose to ignore facts and instead
make outlandish claims in an attempt to continue to spread their own partisan smears.

317,20160609,Dustin van Vugt,Confirmed: #CPC16 a success,"Dear Mike,

It's not often I write you with just a simple update, but I was so pleased with our
entire team and the hard-work they did on our 2016 Conservative Party Convention in
Vancouver, I had to take a moment to put my thoughts down for you.

We had over 3,000 Conservative Party members, delegates, supporters and volunteers
come to Vancouver to help make this convention one of our most successful in our
history - this included our highest number of youth delegates ever. The future of our
party does, indeed, look strong.

And the positivity from Vancouver even spilled over to the newspapers and evening
news shows.

John Ivison on CTV Question Period said the Conservative Party is ""in a position
where they're outfundraising the Liberals, they're drawing thousands to their
convention - they are a legitimate contender at the next election.""

CBC put together a list of ten words to describe our the weekend, including
""democratic"", ""proud"", ""united"",""young"" and ""happy"".

In the Toronto Sun, David Akin wrote that ""The party comes out of Vancouver with some
confidence in its purpose, satisfaction in its strength, and unified about its
mission.""

And my personal favourite is the Postmedia headline ""Tory convention beat out
Liberals"".

So whether you read the National Post's take that we're ""in a good position to beat
the government like an old rug for the next four years"", or agree with the Globe and
Mail that the Conservatives are ""fun, fashion and fiscal responsibility"", I do hope
that you enjoyed everything we had to offer in Vancouver either first hand or through
following it on social media or in the news.

One thing is clear - this would not have been the success it was without party
supporters like you. For that, we at Conservative Party headquarters say thank you.

Thank you for your strong support, and thank you for your dedication to this party.

We're officially looking forward to the next Convention!

322,20160628,Cory Hann,The Big 3,"Dear Mike,

I'll keep this brief: after 10 years in government, Canadians were more prosperous
and safer thanks to the hard work of our Conservative government.

In six short months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government have
done their best to undo all of the progress we made.

It was challenging, but we've boiled down all of Trudeau's ""accomplishments"" in to
these 3 we think you should be most concerned about:

Massive tax hikes – whether it's his new CPP payroll tax, a Carbon Tax, or hints at a
GST hike, he hasn't found a tax hike he didn't like.  Out of control debt – with more
than three times the ""modest"" deficit he promised, he has already burned through the
surplus we left.  No response to global terrorism – when pressed as to when he would
support military action against terrorists, he called it a ""nonsensical question"" and
refused to answer. Seriously.

We've got three and a half more years of this – Justin Trudeau is just getting
started.

We're the only Party that stands up to Justin Trudeau on behalf of everyday
Canadians.

Sincerely,

Cory Hann

323,20160630,Rona Ambrose,It's about you,"Dear Mike,

As the first parliamentary session under this Liberal government draws to a close, we
have seen how out of touch they are with ordinary Canadians.

In the last several months, the Liberals have added billions of dollars in debt while
at the same time wasting millions of taxpayers' dollars on renovating their Ottawa
offices and taking their families on vanity trips. They also pushed through changes
to our national anthem and they plan to ram through major electoral reform
legislation - without letting Canadians vote on it!

But our Conservative caucus is hard at work. Our Party is providing stable and
principled opposition against this government that refuses to listen to hardworking
Canadian taxpayers.

Why do we do it? Because of people like you. Every day we work hard to stand up for
Canadian families like yours against Liberal entitlement and reckless spending.

We raised more money than the Liberals in the first quarter this year. Tomorrow marks
the end of the second quarter, and we need to maintain this fundraising advantage. It
helps us bring our message to more Canadians, but more importantly, it makes sure
we'll be ready to take on the Liberals in 2019!

Please keep the momentum going, because there is A LOT more work to do.  Help us
finish this quarter strong—donate $50 now! [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-

324,20160701,Dustin van Vugt,Have a great weekend!,"Dear Mike,

Happy Canada Day weekend!

Here at Conservative HQ, we keep an eye on Liberal and NDP fundraising activities. I
am on their email lists, and in the last few days alone I have received 10 emails
from the Liberals, and 8 from the NDP, all with desperate fundraising asks. This is
because every three months, political parties need to report their donation numbers
to Elections Canada, and they are trying to boost their numbers before the end of
June.

We could be doing the same thing – but we decided not to. We value supporters like
you, and only want to send you fundraising asks when it is necessary.

So today I'm just emailing you to wish you a very Happy Canada Day. I hope you get a
chance to enjoy the weekend and spend some time with friends and family - I know I
will be spending the weekend with my two year old twin boys!

Thank you so much for your continued support.

Cheers,

Dustin

327,20160709,Dustin van Vugt,Canada Post shut down,"Dear Mike,

During the 2015 election, Trudeau's Liberals promised door-to-door mail delivery for
all Canadians.

In fact, they even promised a review of Canada Post to make sure that it ""provides
high-quality service at a reasonable price to Canadians, no matter where they live.""

Now, Canada Post is about to get locked out - and Justin Trudeau is refusing to do
anything about it!

Postal services are essential for small businesses, charity organizations, and
entrepreneurs who are the backbone of the Canadian economy.

Our previous Conservative government always put the needs of Canadians who rely on
postal service first. As such, there were no extended postal service disruptions when
we were in power.

Justin Trudeau: promises door-to-door delivery for all Canadians – instead ensures
there is NO mail service for ANY Canadians.

The Liberals are still trying to ram through legislation to fundamentally change the

We made a lot of noise when the Liberals first put together the Liberal-stacked
""committee"" to push this issue forward. It was clear to us they would do anything to
avoid putting the question directly to Canadians through a referendum.

Instead, they changed the make-up of the committee. Despite that, the outcome is
still the same – an elite committee of select MPs deciding how they will get elected
in future elections!

That leaves our Conservative Party as the only party that believes the Canadian
people, and the Canadian people alone, should determine how they elect their
governments.

We will continue fighting, but we can't do it without your help –  do your part and

after Liberal government has done to Ontario.

There's been scathing report after scathing report about the waste, fraud, and
mismanagement under the Liberals in Ontario. From over-paying on Hydro and
electricity rates, to the billions in wasteful debt and the costly scandals, Ontario
is more and more an economic basket case – and it's the taxpayers that are entirely
on the hook for it all.

The modest deficits that the Ontario Liberals first promised when they were elected
have now ballooned into a massive structural debt problem limiting economic growth in
Ontario and making it harder for families to get by – sound familiar?

Justin Trudeau was elected on the same promise. Now his deficit has reached $30
billion despite not being in office for a year yet. This is debt that you and your
family have to pay back. It's your money.

We need to limit the damage of Justin Trudeau and the Liberals to a single term. Our
fund is being setup to pay for regional organizers, training and preparation in every
riding across the country – starting now – to win back government and put Canada back
on track at the next election.

It is a headline no one wanted to see. For the first time since the Liberals were in
power last time, crime is up all across Canada.

Our Conservative Government was tough on crime – something we will never apologize
for.

We introduced mandatory minimum sentences for violent, repeat offenders. We stripped
dual national terrorists of their Canadian citizenship. We removed over 50 criminals
on the CBSA list from Canada. And we oversaw a constant decline in crime rates.

Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau sees things differently.

He has actively spoken out against our minimum sentences for violent, repeat
offenders.

And he is in favour of reinstating Canadian citizenship to convicted terrorists!
Seriously – he actually wants to give citizenship back to people who want to kill
innocent Canadians.

This recent spike in crime is concerning – and Justin Trudeau's notoriously soft-on-
crime approach should be even more concerning now than ever before. He needs to take
the safety of Canadians seriously.

Raising taxes on job-creating businesses.  Hiking CPP taxes on your paycheque, which
will cost a family with two working parents as much as $2,200 a year.  Cutting
billions of dollars in tax credits that allow Canadian families to save for the
future and for their children.  Saddling us and our children with debt ($30 BILLION
this year alone!)

Mike, only our Conservative Party is standing up for hardworking Canadians like you
who are tired of seeing the Liberals waste hard-earned tax dollars you hand over.

owners are worried about losing their shirts with all these Liberal taxes.

Taxes are a pain. They put Canadians out of work. They take money away from families.
They make everyday living more expensive.

That's why our Conservative Government reduced the GST from 7 to 6 to 5 percent, and
cut taxes for every single Canadian family. We reduced the tax burden to the lowest
level in 50 years, leaving more money in the pockets of Canadian families. (And we
balanced the budget, too!)

carbon tax which will drive up the cost of everything!

By now you've all seen the photo of Trudeau shirtless at the beach. The media have
plastered it everywhere, and thousands of people have shared it on social media.

While others used the photo to paint Trudeau in a celebrity moment, we used it to
point out what he was doing while 110,000 Canadians lost their jobs in June and July.

After pointing that out, we received a lawyer's letter demanding we pull down the
picture -  that same picture shared repeatedly around the globe.

The real lesson here is that there is no limit to the lengths that the Liberals and
their friends will go to in order to protect Justin's image.

It is not easy to ‎fight this ""celebrity culture"". But we have to.

Please donate $50 NOW and that money will be put directly towards Facebook ads today
that counter the Trudeau spin machine! [http://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-

345,20160819,Conservative HQ,BREAKING: Liberals wasting more of your money,"Dear Mike,

Since being elected, the Liberals have plunged Canada back into deficit and racked up
billions of dollars in new debt. While doing this, they cancelled tax breaks for you,
and lined up some pretty nice perks for themselves.

The most recent example? $1,700 for a one-day limo ride around Toronto.

But wait – that's not all!!

Not only did Health Minister Jane Philpott spend $1,700 to ride around Toronto in a
limo for one day – but the limo company she used is owned by one of her campaign
workers!

You got that?

The Liberals are taking your money and spending it needlessly on expensive limo rides
– from the same people that helped get her elected.

Does that pass your smell test?

$1,700 for a one-day limo ride when there are less costly options like rental cars
and Uber is a new low for these limousine Liberals.

346,20160819,Erin O'Toole,Standing up to the threat of terror,"Dear Mike,

Under Conservatives, Canada did not hesitate to stand up to the threat of terror. We
joined the coalition fight against ISIS. We strengthened Canadian laws against
terrorists. And we introduced the Anti-Terrorism Act.

We've seen the threat of terrorism before. It happened on Parliament Hill and it has
even happened in a quiet town in Quebec. In both instances, they were brazen attacks
against uniformed members of our Canadian Armed Forces.

Last week was a chilling reminder that the threat of terrorism in Canada is real.

Thanks to cooperation between our security agencies and those of our allies, this
terrorist was stopped before he could do greater harm. Our Anti-Terrorism Act put
into law that these communications between agencies and governments can, and should,
happen more frequently. We're proud that this type of cooperation helped lead our
police force to the individual planning to bring ISIS terror to Canadian soil again.

Every day our Conservative MPs look for ways we can better protect Canada. This is
not a partisan issue – the safety of Canadians is too important.

That said, sometimes we have to honestly disagree with the Liberals. This is one of
those times.

The Liberals are moving to unravel the very laws we introduced that encouraged better
cooperation and communications to keep Canadians safe.

Our job in opposition is to hold them to account. But we can't do it alone.

Canada must remain secure, and all parties have a responsibility to ensure it stays
that way. We need supporters like you to help us spread our message – it's not free.

Can you chip in $50 today? [http://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-

We're going to use the money to reach out to Canadians over social media platforms –
and tell them about this wrong-headed move from the Liberals to repeal parts of the
Anti-Terrorism Act as they stubbornly push ahead with their changes.

As always, we appreciate and are counting on your generous support.

348,20160823,Conservative HQ,**CORRECTION** Let the record be clear,"** CORRECTION **

Dear Mike,

Last week we told you about the Liberals getting up to their same old tricks.

The Liberal Health Minister was caught red-handed doling out more than $7,000 in
taxpayer dollars to one of her Liberal insider friends that worked on her election
campaign.

We have an important update though!

When it was reported that Minister Jane Philpott was charging taxpayers for limo
service around Toronto at an obscene rate, the Liberals moved quickly to ensure
everyone got the story right, and pointed out that it was actually a Lexus, and not a
limousine.

So to be clear: it wasn't paying over $7,000 in taxpayer dollars to her insider
friend's limo company for a limousine rental – it was over $7,000 in taxpayer dollars
to her Liberal insider friend's limo company for a Lexus rental!

When we originally called Minister Philpott a Limousine Liberal, we should have
called her a Lexus Liberal.

The confusion is understandable. We figured charging taxpayers $1,700 for a one day
ride around Toronto from a limo company owned by her campaign worker was obviously
for a limo.

We stand corrected. It was, in fact, $1,700 for a one day ride around Toronto from a
limo company owned by her campaign worker – in a Lexus.

We regret the error.

It's more bad news for the Canadian economy.

The last time we saw an economic drop this bad was the second quarter of 2009 – when
the country was in the middle of a financial crisis and a worldwide recession!

Only this time, there is no recession. And the only crisis is what Justin Trudeau is
doing:

He's introducing a CPP tax hike that will cost a family with two working parents as
much as $2,200 a year;  He's breaking his promise to reduce taxes for small
businesses;  He's slashing the amounts that Canadians can save tax-free;  He's ending
the Children's Fitness Tax Credit;  He's ending the Children's Art Tax Credit; and
He's ending tax credits for post-secondary education and textbooks.

Justin Trudeau promised to keep deficit spending under $10 billion annually and to
keep taxes low for middle-class families. He has broken both of those promises.

All the Liberals know how to do is spend, spend, spend. And you're going to be stuck
with the bill.

The weather is getting cooler, kids are back in school, and MPs are set to return to
Ottawa in less than two weeks. Sadly, summer is drawing to a close.

What did Justin Trudeau's Liberals get up to this summer? Well, they had a lot of
retreats.

There was a retreat at luxury mountain resort in Alberta in April which they spent
$248,934 of your money on;  There was a retreat in Sudbury in August; and  There was
a retreat in Saguenay, Quebec in August.

All these retreats led me to ponder the obvious question: what exactly are they
""retreating"" from?

Well, where do I start…

Liberal MP Catherine McKenna was caught spending $17,000 on vanity photos of herself.
Liberal MP Jane Philpott was caught spending $7,508 on limo service (from a Liberal
insider.)  Liberal MP Jim Carr was caught spending $1,783 for hockey tickets and a
five-block limo ride.  Liberal MP Amarjeet Sohi spent a whopping $835,000 – for
renovations and new paintings for his office!

The recent economic data isn't too good either: this summer saw two straight months
of economic decline. That's the worst economic drop since 2009 – when the country was
in the middle of a financial crisis and a worldwide recession!

When you look at it this way, their ""retreats"" become more understandable – they're
retreating from their own messes/mismanagement!

Thankfully, they can't retreat forever. Our Conservative MPs are back in Ottawa in
less than two weeks, and you can be sure they're going to be holding this Liberal
government's feet to the fire. But we can't do it without your help.  Donate $50 to

As you all know, Justin Trudeau and his Finance Minister Bill Morneau broke their
election promise and introduced a budget that would plunge Canada back into deficit.

They tried to justify their $30 billion in new debt by claiming that half of their
new child benefit would be spent, and would stimulate the economy as a result.

But yesterday's Bloomberg headline couldn't have been clearer:

bring alcohol across provincial borders.

Mike,

Our Conservative government brought in federal legislation to allow Canadians to
bring alcohol across provincial borders. But did you know it's still illegal in many
jurisdictions to move alcohol across provincial borders?

That's because many provinces still haven't brought in similar legislation allowing
the free movement of legal products within Canada.

This doesn't only hurt consumers, it hurts Canadian beer and wine manufacturers. It
also supports monopolies that disadvantage our small businesses!

Did you also know that right now it is easier for a winery in BC to directly sell
into Asia than it is to sell in Ontario?

This is the type of issue that we're going to be debating next week when the House of
Commons returns for the fall session.

Dear Mike,

After spending the summer in their respective ridings listening to the concerns of
Canadians, our Conservative MPs are in Halifax this week preparing for the return of
the House of Commons!

I've been travelling around the country, working all summer long. And everywhere I
go, I'm hearing the same thing: people are worried.

They're worried about the job losses Canada suffered this summer. They're worried
about the two straight months of economic decline! They're worried about headlines
predicting another financial crisis.

And of course they're worried about their government. They're worried that these are
the same old Liberals - focused only on finding new ways to spend your money, while
driving up debt and taxes.

Well one thing is certain here in Halifax: our Conservative caucus is committed to
being the voice of taxpayers!

We will stand up - always - for every Canadian who values their paycheque and hopes
for a better future for their children.

Before the House of Commons returns next week, we're sending Justin Trudeau a loud
and clear message by trying to raise $100,000 this week.

It's an ambitious goal, but I know our supporters are up to it.

Help us tell Trudeau that Canadians are not happy with his free-spending, high-debt
policies - donate $50 now!

It's going to be hard to believe, but we actually have ANOTHER Liberal Minister
wrongfully charging Canadian taxpayers for expenses!

""Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould charged meals and other expenses to the
Department of Justice on the day she travelled to Toronto for a Liberal Party

wealthy donors in downtown Toronto.

Ottawa at her department's expense. Total cost? $13,322!!

Mike –

As the House of Commons returned this week, and we close in on one year under the
Liberals, Justin Trudeau was desperate to paint his time in office as successful.

The Liberals even tried to celebrate with a rather underwhelming video of their ""kept
promises."" Too bad for them the facts painted a different picture:

That's right. The Liberals talk about Canada being back, and bringing in ""real
change"", but they've only passed ten bills – total.

>> Help us put the needs of Canadians first – donate now! <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

In fact, you have to go back over twenty years to find a government that was as
unproductive as this one!

Sadly, but yet unsurprisingly, the ten bills the Liberals passed were almost all ones
aimed at reversing our hard-work, and making life harder for Canadians. They scrapped
family income splitting, they reversed tax credits for kids' sports and arts
programs, and they brought in a budget bill with a $30 billion deficit.

They've spent a lot of money on trips, office renovations, and photos of themselves –
less tax breaks for you, more perks for them.

Liberal Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould charged taxpayers $13,322 for hotel rooms –
right here in Ottawa.  Liberal Minister Catherine McKenna charged taxpayers $17,000
for vanity pictures of herself.  Liberal Minister Jane Philpott charged taxpayers
$8,000+ for limo rides and access to exclusive airport lounges.  Liberal Minister Jim
Carr charged taxpayers $1,784 for tickets to a hockey game and a five-block limo
ride.

The list goes on and on.

While the Liberals drive up the debt and hike your taxes, they have no problem living
with no expense spared using your money to pay for it.

Dear Mike –

It is a very troubling trend for taxpayers.

Over and over again, the Liberals get caught in an expense scandal. Then they simply
apologize, return (some of) the money, and expect everyone to move on.

In April, Liberal Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould attended a ""pay-to-play"" fundraiser
in which attendees were invited to donate to the Liberal Party in return for access
to the minister. While there, she charged taxpayers for meals. After she was caught,
she repaid the expenses.

Last month, Liberal Minister Jane Philpott was found to have been charging taxpayers
for expensive limo rides around Toronto. When it was found out, she apologized and
paid the money back.

Just last week we found out that two of Justin Trudeau's top aides charged the
taxpayers over $200,000 to move from Toronto to Ottawa! The Globe & Mail summed up my
feelings well:

""The two most powerful unelected people in Ottawa, when given their first opportunity
to reap the benefits of their rise to power, took the taxpayer for as much as
possible. And they did so with the blessing of the Prime Minister, at whose
discretion the expenses were authorized.""

After this was revealed, they apologized and offered to pay some of the money back to
taxpayers.

Now this week we are finding out about even more Liberals bilking taxpayers for
moving expenses.

The Toronto Star is reporting that two other top political staffers charged taxpayers
over $220,000 for moving expenses. Now caught, they are – you guessed it –
apologizing and paying some of it back.

This is a deeply disturbing trend.

And for me, it raises a big other question: if this is the stuff we know about, what
do we not know about? What else are the Liberals wasting your money on?

You might remember this ominous ad, put out by left-leaning “Engage Canada”, a group
we now know had strong Liberal ties. They claimed that our health care policies would
hurt Canadians:

At the time, the Liberals piled on with them, referring to our plan for health care
transfers as “austerity”, “dictatorial”, and an “attack on our seniors and our most
vulnerable.”

That was, of course, ridiculous. But it didn’t stop the Liberals from piggy backing
off these third party groups’ big money TV ads.

One problem - the Liberals now acknowledge their attacks on our policies were
baseless – so they are adopting them.

That’s right – after shamelessly attacking our plan during the election, last week
Justin Trudeau’s Liberals adopted our health care plan!

They pulled a bait-and-switch – they and these third party groups purposely
misinformed Canadians into believing that our plans were somehow scary, and then,
after winning the election, went ahead and used them.

The Liberals and their third party groups were never interested in facts, or
informing Canadians about the issues - they simply wanted to slander our Party.

spending millions of dollars to spread their propaganda against us.

375,20161008,Cory Hann,A tax on everything!,"In case you hadn’t heard yet, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have announced their
latest scheme: forcing through a new carbon tax - a tax on everything!

Dear Mike –

In case you hadn’t heard yet, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals have announced their
latest scheme: forcing through a new carbon tax - a tax on everything!

In 2008 the Liberals called it a “Green Shift”. Now, they’re calling it “Carbon
Pricing”. However, the Prime Minister had a moment of truth in the House of Commons
this week when he accidentally called it what it really is…. a “TAX”.

The reaction to this mandated tax was swift, as three provincial environment
ministers walked out of a meeting in protest.

And just yesterday a National Post headline read “Trudeau’s carbon plan will mean
Canadians will pay more for a tax that will have very little impact.”

>> Help us fight to keep taxes LOWER. Donate now. <<  [https://donate.conservative.ca
/help-put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

Canadians pay enough taxes already, but under Trudeau’s Carbon Tax scheme, the cost
of everything is going to go up. This includes gas, groceries, and the cost to keep
your home warm in the winter.

Our Conservative Government previously set realistic, achievable environmental
targets. In fact, those goals, which the Liberals spent years denouncing, are now the
same targets the Liberals have set as their own.

The decision to impose this tax continues a trend of costly, inefficient, bad Liberal
policy. And hardworking taxpayers like you will have to pay for it!

Our Party is the only party fighting for the taxpayer. Are you able to help us stand
up against wasteful new tax hikes?  Donate $50 now! [https://donate.conservative.ca

Dear Mike –

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be forcing a Carbon Tax onto every
part of the country – whether they want it or not.

Three provincial ministers walked out of a meeting in protest, and several Premiers
expressed their dissatisfaction (to put it nicely!)

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall was so surprised by this forced tax on Canadians and
the provinces he said “the level of disrespect shown by the Prime Minister and his
government…is stunning.”

In fact, Saskatchewan is now looking at legal options to fight the carbon tax -
including taking the Trudeau government to the Supreme Court!

The Prime Minister went back on his word to lower small business taxes.

He went back on his word to run “only” a $10 billion deficit.

And now, he is about to cost you a lot more.

His new Carbon Tax could cost you an extra $1,250 per year!

Justin Trudeau and the Liberals couldn’t be trusted on the economy.

Dear Mike –

This time last year Conservatives were going door-to-door warning Canadians that
Justin Trudeau and the Liberals couldn’t be trusted on the economy.

Fast forward one year, and, sure enough, their promised “modest” $10 billion deficit
tripled by the time the budget rolled around.

That’s right - in just 6 months, the deficit ballooned to $30 billion.

That was bad enough, but yesterday a TD report came out with news that Canada’s
finances are going to take another whopping hit, with the debt expected to jump
another $5 billion this fiscal year!

For the Liberals, getting the numbers right is of little concern. To them, five
BILLION taxpayer dollars is just a rounding error.

Support us in stopping Liberal mismanagement. Donate $50!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

In the same TD report, economists suggested that Canada’s financial outlook is even
bleaker than the Liberals are letting on, saying it’s a “serially disappointing
economy” that is “not meeting expectations.”

It’s clear: the Liberal plan simply isn’t working.

And when the Liberals’ plans don’t work, what does that mean for taxpayers like you?
Higher taxes.

The Liberals have already cancelled our Conservative tax breaks like income splitting
for families, and our Universal Child Care benefits.  And they recently announced
they plan to raise taxes on everything with a new punishing CARBON TAX grab.

These massive Liberal debts need to be paid back and it’s regular Canadians who are
going to be on the hook.

381,20161019,Cory Hann,$35 billion…,"Lower taxes, balanced budgets, a plan for sustained growth of the economy, helping
middle class families – these are just some of the things our party fights for.

Dear Mike,

One year ago, Conservative candidates were canvassing day and night, reminding
Canadians of the great things our party had accomplished since 2006, and hoped to
accomplish in the future.

Lower taxes, balanced budgets, sustained economic growth, help for middle class
families – these are just some of the things our party fights for.

Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party campaigned on “small” deficits and big promises;
most of which have been abandoned - or broken!

Canadians learned just how badly the Liberals had misled them when they presented
their first budget in April. A promised $10 billion deficit had somehow become $30
billion overnight!

Canadians weren’t happy – here is just some of what was said:

“Trudeau’s first budget is an absolute disaster for future generations & thus
Canada.”         - Aaron Gunn, Canadian Taxpayer Federation  “Running chronic
deficits with no plan to balance the budget has proven to be bad news for Canada’s
economy.”         - Halifax Chamber of Commerce  “The federal deficit for 2016/17
translates into roughly $840 for every Canadian – ouch.”    -Rob Roach, ATB Financial
“Truth be told….the government is not giving money to people based on the economic
quintile they occupy. The Liberals are giving money to people who vote for the
Liberals.”         - Sahir Khan, ex-PBO Budget Specialist  “The federal government’s
first budget contained a number of broken commitments to small- to-medium-sized
business owners…… This is expected to cost small firms over $900 million more per
year by 2019.”

- Canadian Federation of Independent Business

The budget may have been tabled half a year ago, but it is still surprising us: just
last week, a TD forecast predicted that this year’s deficit would be even bigger: $35
billion.

Justin Trudeau and the Liberals simply can’t be trusted on the economy.

The bad news is, we have three more years of this. The good news is that you can do
something to help fight this big debt and higher taxes right now:

Whether it’s making phone calls or knocking doors in neighbourhoods across the

Dear Mike,

This week marked the one-year anniversary since the election of the Liberal
government.

Justin Trudeau campaigned on some hefty promises… but Canadians have been duped.

Other than driving up the debt, raising taxes, and cutting benefits for hard-working
families, Canadians have seen no tangible policy changes.

The Huffington Post reported that Justin Trudeau’s first months in office have been
the “least productive of any government... in more than two decades”.

Recent polling numbers show “nearly half of all poll respondents were at a loss when
asked to name an accomplishment the government has achieved in the past year.”

The Liberals put out a video to mark the one year anniversary of their election win.
What did it contain? A whole bunch of pictures of Trudeau — but couldn’t point to
even a single new policy!

It’s clear the Prime Minister is sticking to what he does best - selfies and photo
ops.

Canadians deserve a government that works hard for them, not one that is focused
endlessly on vanity, while sweeping major issues (such as their skyrocketing debt!)
under the rug.

Here’s just a sample of what Canadians have put up with over the past year:

Justin Trudeau began breaking promises almost immediately after taking office.

He blew through his “modest” deficit promise, borrowing three times more than he ever
said he would.  He broke his promise to cut taxes for small businesses.  He broke his
promise to make his tax plan revenue-neutral.

Justin Trudeau has betrayed the middle class by raising taxes and will be raising
them again.

He made kids’ sports and arts classes more expensive, along with tools for
tradespeople and textbooks for students.  He took away the Universal Child Care
Benefit.  He clawed back the ability for Canadians to save in tax-free savings
accounts.  And a whopping CPP tax hike and a carbon tax are on the way.

Justin Trudeau has already established a record of economic failure.

The economy is stagnant. Despite all the spending, the Bank of Canada, the IMF and
the OECD have all downgraded their forecasts for Canada this year and the next.  Good
jobs are in short supply. The vast majority of new jobs created under the Liberals
have been part-time.  Meanwhile, the cost of living goes up. It’s harder for
Canadians to afford a home and new federal rules announced this month mean fewer will
be able to get a mortgage.

As the only party standing up and being the voice of the taxpayer, Conservatives have
been busy over the past year. The next few years will be even busier.

I’m eager to join my colleagues in Ottawa, and to get to work fighting for taxpayers
like you.

Well, that didn’t take long….

In less than a year, Justin Trudeau has gone from preaching the virtues of openness
and accountability, to throwing his own rules out the window.

Trudeau has worked hard to paint a squeaky-clean image of himself and his government
- but today we learned about yet another 'Pay-to-Play' scheme, in which the Liberals
sell access to high-ranking government Ministers in exchange for big donations to the
Liberal Party!

This event is just the latest in what the Globe and Mail describes as “at least 20
instances this year where the Trudeau Liberals are asking Canadians to pay as much as
$1,500 to spend time at private residences, hotels or other venues with senior
ministers who are responsible for major spending and policy decisions.”

The media asked the Liberals for a confirmed list of Ministerial fundraisers held
this year. The Liberals refused.

So much for their openness and accountability!

Governments are elected to represent all Canadians - not just the elites chasing

Dear Mike,

Last night, our Conservative candidate Glen Motz won big in an Alberta by-election in
Medicine Hat – Cardston – Warner!

With each vote in 2016, Canadians are making their voices heard loud and clear.

Back in April, Brad Wall and his conservative Saskatchewan Party were re-elected with
a whopping 62.5% of the vote!  In Manitoba, Brian Pallister’s Progressive
Conservative Party took office with a historic 40 seat majority government!  Two by-
elections in Ontario produced similar results for Progressive Conservative candidates
- Lorne Coe won with 53% of the vote and Raymond Cho won a riding that had been held
by the Liberals for 17 years!

And now we have a federal vote that sends a message directly to Justin Trudeau.

With 70% of the vote going Conservative last night, Canadians are clearly standing
against the Liberal government’s massive debt, tax hikes, and their plans for a job
killing carbon tax.

I look forward to welcoming Glen to Ottawa. As Conservatives, we’re fighting a
Liberal government that continues to mismanage the economy and fails to understand
that creating jobs must be the top priority.

federal Lobbying Commissioner!

Dear Mike,

One year in, and the Liberals are already under investigation for fundraising tactics
that not just go against their own rules, but has them under the microscope of the
federal Lobbying Commissioner!

According to the Globe and Mail, the federal lobbying commissioner “is investigating
what she called the governing Liberals’ “pay-for-access” fundraisers to determine
whether senior Trudeau cabinet ministers have breached the Lobbying Act.”

Justin Trudeau promised there would be no preferential access to government Ministers
for wealthy elites.

… that is, I guess, unless donations were given to the Liberal Party.

Media reports say at least 20 Liberal “pay for play” events have taken place this
year. At least one of these is for the Finance Minister - and being organized by an
executive with a company that lobbies the same Finance Minister!!

Does that pass your smell test? Help combat these unethical Liberal Fundraisers –
donate $50 [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-
first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50].

These exclusive access events are certainly breaking the Prime Minister’s own rules –
but unfortunately, they’re also allowing the Liberals to close the fundraising gap.

We rely on honest, ethical fundraising methods, from supporters like you.

by-election in Medicine Hat – Cardston – Warner!

Dear Mike,

This past Monday, our Conservative candidate Glen Motz won big in an Alberta by-
election in Medicine Hat – Cardston – Warner!

With each vote in 2016, Canadians are making their voices heard loud and clear.

Back in April, Brad Wall and his conservative Saskatchewan Party were re-elected with
a whopping 62.5% of the vote!  In Manitoba, Brian Pallister’s Progressive
Conservative Party took office with a historic 40 seat majority government!  Two by-
elections in Ontario produced similar results for Progressive Conservative candidates
- Lorne Coe won with 53% of the vote and Raymond Cho won a riding that had been held
by the Liberals for 17 years!

And now we have a federal vote that sends a message directly to Justin Trudeau.

With 70% of the vote going Conservative on Monday, Canadians are clearly standing
against the Liberal government’s massive debt, tax hikes, and their plans for a job
killing carbon tax.

I look forward to welcoming Glen to Ottawa. As Conservatives, we’re fighting a
Liberal government that continues to mismanage the economy and fails to understand
that creating jobs must be the top priority.

All of these conservative victories are thanks to the continued support of people
like you. Without you, the Liberals would remain unchecked right across the country.

This Liberal scheme completely goes against the Prime Minister’s own rules, and has

Dear Mike,

A “modest $10 billion deficit” will result in new jobs, Trudeau told Canadians last
year.

Now we know better.

Yesterday’s Fall Economic update proves that the Liberal economic plan has failed.

$30 billion – and they still haven’t added an additional new full time job or grown

Unbelievably, yesterday’s fiscal update adds yet another $32 billion to the deficit
over the next few years.

even more money – money that will have to be paid back by Canadian workers, families,
and job creators.

Your third quarter donations allowed us to continue holding the Liberals to account.

Dear Mike,

The Sponsorship Scandal is ancient history, right?

Wrong!

This past week - yes, in 2016, 12 years after this first came to light – former
federal Liberal organizer Jacques Corriveau was found guilty of influence peddling,
forgery and laundering proceeds of crime.

Court testimony during his trial shed more light on the systemic corruption plaguing
the Liberal Party, especially over their outrageously corrupt use of taxpayer money
to pad their own coffers.

Some of the testimony alleged:

Corriveau pocketing $6.5 million by using his firm to defraud Ottawa during the
sponsorship program.  $165,000 to buy the silence of a party bagman arrested and
charged in an influence-peddling scheme.  Over $700,000 benefitting several Liberal
insiders and the Liberal Party of Canada itself.  Further testimony indicates the
Liberal Party was facing serious ""cash flow problems"" in the 1990's. So naturally,
the Liberal government of the day found a way to funnel tax dollars to their friends.

Unfortunately, as the Globe & Mail noted, this trial ""generated almost no media
coverage.""

Shocking.

And now that Corriveau has been found guilty, the Liberal Party is refusing to
reimburse taxpayers in relation to the previously unknown details exposed during the
trial.

Mike, we need supporters like you to help get the word out in our fight against
Liberal corruption.

Help us bring this systemic Liberal corruption to light. Donate $50 now.

Dear Mike,

It’s been a bad few days for Liberals.

Justin Trudeau’s gang are under investigation for unethical “pay for access”
fundraisers.

And one of their party organizers was found guilty of fraud.

In Ontario, the O.P.P. laid bribery charges against the Ontario Liberal Party CEO.
She also happens to be Kathleen Wynne's former deputy chief of staff.

And what is the public reaction to this? Kathleen Wynne has to go!

A poll by Mainstreet/Postmedia shows two thirds of Ontarians disagree with the job
Kathleen Wynne is doing.

What's worse for the Ontario premier - more than half surveyed want her gone!

Canadians are saying no to Liberal policies of massive debt, higher taxes and broken
promises.

And it’s clear: Ontarians are done with Kathleen Wynne.

They are fed up seeing their tax dollars wasted, done with the political scandals,
and sick and tired of not being able to pay their hydro bills – a recipe Justin

Dear Mike,

Ever wish you had over $120,000 of other people’s money to spend as you please?

Welcome to Justin Trudeau’s world!

Last summer, Justin paid a quick visit to the “summer camp for billionaires.” Why?
So he could hobnob with America’s wealthiest elites at an exclusive conference.

Justin Trudeau and his cabinet just can’t burn through your money fast enough.

Last week, the Liberals announced they are taking Canada a further $130 billion into
deficit.

130,000,000,000 / 120,000 = 1,083,333

The extra debt that Trudeau is piling on the backs of taxpayers could buy him over a
million more $120,000 trips to this summer camp for billionaires.

Earlier this year, the Liberals got caught with their hand in the cookie jar once too

returning:

16 Ministers and their staff - costs for hotels, plane tickets, train fares, and
“decorations”.  Over $1,000… to park their cars at work.  One well paid Liberal
wouldn’t even foot the bill for a measly 3 bucks, expensing it so the taxpayer could
pick up the tab.

Dear Mike,

Last year, it became clear Justin Trudeau would say anything to get elected.
(“Modest” $10 billion deficits, anyone?)

So is anyone surprised his MPs were caught spinning the truth about their
credentials?

First was Science Minister Kirsty Duncan.  She once claimed to be a Nobel Prize
winner.

That claim proved to be more fiction than fact.

And now Liberal MP Majid Jowhari is apologizing for misleading his constituents
during the election when he falsely referred to himself as a professional engineer.

Of course his apology only came AFTER charges were laid for fabricating his
qualifications.

True to Liberal form, a forced apology and a donation made it go away.

Jowhari was effectively forced to either take on the charges or offer a full public
apology and make a $5,000 donation.

To avoid any “undue hardship” to the perpetrators of the crime.

crime.

Dear Mike,

Is Justin Trudeau willing to sell out Canada to the highest bidder?

For a high enough political donation, it looks that way!

The Globe and Mail is reporting the Prime Minister crossed the line.

The appearance of mixing government business with the political donations process
flies in the face of the rules Trudeau himself introduced.

The Prime Minister was the guest of honour at one his now infamous “cash for access”
fundraisers.

According to the report, several “Chinese billionaires” were in attendance. This
included a tycoon waiting for government approval to start his latest banking venture
in Canada.

At this point, I’ll give you a guess about what happened next.

That’s right…. AFTER the fundraiser, the Finance Minister’s department gave the go
ahead for Trudeau’s newest backer to begin operations.

And now we learn another attendee made a $1 million dollar donation to the Trudeau
Foundation, which included money to build a statue of the Prime Minister’s father.

In the past Trudeau spoke of his “admiration” for China and their “basic
dictatorship.” Now he stays busy cozying up to Chinese billionaires in return for big
donations to his Liberal Party.

The Prime Minister and his cabinet break their own conflict of interest rules on a
regular basis – and yet they keep doing it.

in the name of padding Liberal bank accounts.

Justin Trudeau’s statement on the passing of Fidel Castro has been rightfully

He chose to celebrate a tyrant while the rest of the world celebrated for the Cuban

His nostalgic ""sorrow"" at the death of a ruthless communist dictator has made Canada

Instead, he recognized ""Cuba's longest serving Head of State"". He said nothing of the
Cubans Castro executed, imprisoned, tortured, oppressed and exiled.

Other world leaders referenced the many ways Castro denied Cuban's basic fundamental
human rights.

But not Justin!

In what some have called a love letter to the Castro family, Trudeau gushed about the
Cuban dictator.  Calling him “larger than life…a legendary revolutionary and orator.”

421,20161201,Dustin van Vugt,Liberal cash-for-access just got worse,"Justin Trudeau’s ""Cash-for-Access"" scheme is in the news again and details continue
to leak about their unethical fundraising methods.

Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau’s ""Cash-for-Access"" scheme is in the news again and details continue
to leak about their unethical fundraising methods.

First, the Finance Minister was caught red handed attending a fundraiser organized by
a pharmaceutical executive…whose company is lobbying the Finance Minister!

Then the PM was rubbing elbows with a Communist Chinese billionaires looking for
government favours, which were later granted…after they made a million dollar
donation to the Trudeau Foundation!

Now the Globe and Mail has exposed another of Trudeau’s half-baked plans: to have his
point person on marijuana, Bill Blair, fundraise with…members of the Marijuana
industry!

It just doesn’t stop with this gang.

The former police chief of Canada’s largest city met with wannabe-legal pot dealers
in exchange for cash donations to the Liberals.

It’s clear the Liberals are addicted to these fundraisers. They are intent on
breaking their own rules to pad their own bank accounts.

Help us stand up for ethical government – donate $50 now.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

When questioned about the ethical implications of her own attendance at the
fundraiser, one marijuana lobbyist had a lot to say.

Liberals organizers “took our money happily, without question” she said.

We need your help to stop the Liberals from abusing their positions in government.

Another day, another embarrassing performance from the Liberals.

Yesterday the multi-partisan special committee on electoral reform submitted their
report.

And guess what?

The committee report backed our position - that without a referendum, there should be
no changes to the way we vote.

Can you guess what the Liberal response was?

They called the report, “too radical,” “rushed,” and “unnecessarily hasty.”

Help us fight for democracy - donate $50. [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-
canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

If Trudeau and Democratic Institutions Minister Maryam Monsef want to change the
rules of democracy, every Canadian must have a say.

Monsef disagreed, and put on a shameful and embarrassing spectacle inside Parliament.

In an utterly excruciating performance in the House of Commons, Monsef showed her
true colours and proved that, like Liberals long before, a Liberal promise today
still isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.

What we got was excuse after excuse in attempt to discredit the hard work of the
committee members. She even went so far as to accuse them of not doing the “hard work
expected of them” despite receiving an over 300 page report on exactly the work her
and Justin Trudeau asked them to do.

It is clear that Trudeau and Monsef already had an outcome in mind when they started
this process, and it wasn’t a referendum.

Now their plan has backfired. The report is clear – Canadians don’t agree with them.

424,20161204,Peter Kent,Trudeau on Castro,"Other world leaders spoke of the barbaric nature in which Castro ruled Cuba. They
referenced the many way he denied Cubans basic fundamental human rights. But not
Justin!

Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau’s statement on the passing of Fidel Castro has been rightfully
ridiculed by our democratic allies.

He chose to celebrate a tyrant while the rest of the world celebrated for the Cuban
people.

His nostalgic ""sorrow"" at the death of a ruthless communist dictator has made Canada
a laughing stock around the world.

Instead of paying a romanticized tribute to Castro, Justin Trudeau should have
offered condolences to the long-suffering, oppressed people of Cuba.

The Prime Minister should have spoken of Canada's hopes for a better, democratic
future for the people of Cuba.

Instead, he recognized ""Cuba's longest serving Head of State"". He said nothing of the
Cubans Castro executed, imprisoned, tortured, oppressed and exiled.

Other world leaders referenced the many ways Castro denied Cuban's basic fundamental
human rights.

But not Justin!

In what some have called a love letter to the Castro family, Trudeau gushed about the
Cuban dictator.  Calling him “larger than life…a legendary revolutionary and orator.”

Really?!

We already know he would rather cozy up to dictators than be working in the House of
Commons in unprincipled pursuit of Security Council votes.

This stands in stark contrast to our Conservative government`s principled foreign
policy!

Trudeau’s personal affection of this dictator is not shared by all Canadians.

Justin Trudeau should not celebrate the life of a tyrant. Donate $50 today if you
agree. [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-

They don’t want a big new Carbon Tax grab.

carbon tax grab is the worst option for emission reductions.

Why? Because every Canadian will be forced to pay more for everything from gas, to
groceries, to hydro bills - all to pad the bank accounts of government.

The Liberals just can’t get enough of your money.

As you know, they’ve been filling their party coffers thanks to unethical fundraisers
- and some news outlets are even going as far as calling these as possibly illegal
political fundraisers.

Chinese communist billionaires, lobbyists looking for favours, pot dealers - the
Liberals don't care who gets special government access...

... as long as they’re willing to make huge donations to the Liberal Party or the
Trudeau Foundation.

Now, Justin's gang has come up with yet another (not-so-new) way to funnel taxpayer
money to Liberal Party coffers!

Help us hold Trudeau to one term only - donate $50 now!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/one-term-trudeau?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

The last time the Liberals were in power they brought in a per-vote subsidy, which
forced taxpayers to subsidize the partisan activity of political parties. As a
result, hundreds of millions of dollars were paid to political parties.

When we were elected, we put a stop to that. We eliminated the per vote subsidy
altogether, so political parties were no longer free to live off your tax dollars.

Now the Liberals want to bring it back.

Reported just yesterday:

“The per-vote-subsidy is the fairest and the most legitimate way of supporting
political parties.”

- Liberal MP Alexandra Mendes

“Some form of public subsidy should occur and it’s a good idea.”

- Liberal MP Robert Falcon-Ouellette

“I prefer it for a whole lot of reasons""….""So it’s just better.”

- Liberal MP Bill Casey

“There’s some attractiveness to it. It’s worth examining.”

- Liberal MP Marc Miller

Political funding should come from people like you, who choose to make a donation.

But the Liberals want to force all taxpayers to pay for their partisan activities. We
can’t let that happen - we need to hold Justin Trudeau to one term only.

430,20161209,Peter Van Loan,How much are you willing to pay the CBC?,"Now the CBC is asking for even more. A whole lot more!

Dear Mike,

For years, critics of the CBC have watched the network carelessly spend the more-
than-generous taxpayer funding they receive.

While other networks have to rely on privately funding their news, CBC had little to
worry about.

Funding kept going up, and the CBC became more and more out of touch. As other
networks began their newscasts with the hottest issue of the day, the CBC could be
found missing the mark or burying a lead (I know I especially noticed even more when
that lead was a bad news story about the Trudeau Liberal government).

Despite the 2016 budget handing Canadians a $30 billion deficit, the Trudeau Liberals
somehow managed to find an extra $150 million for the public broadcaster.

That, of course, was is in addition to the $1 billion per year it already receives in
tax payer subsides.

But it doesn’t stop there.

Now the CBC is asking for even more. A whole lot more!

In their pre-budget submission, the CBC asked for another $400 million per year. For
those keeping track, that’s $1,600,000,000.00. Every single year.

Help us stand up for Canadian taxpayers – donate $50 today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-first?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

And after that, they want guaranteed annual increases ... forever.

When it comes to the CBC, it seems it’s just never enough. With hemorrhaging deficits
and massive Liberal tax hikes on the way, this is spending that Canadians simply
can’t afford.

We’re going to continue standing up for Canadian taxpayers, against this type of
Liberal abuse.

Foreign donations for personal benefits, selling access to government, expense
scandals.

As the Trudeau Liberals moral and ethical standards plummet, so does their approval
rating.

A new Forum Research poll shows the Liberals are down almost 10%.

Canadians aren't happy with Trudeau's cash-for-access scheme, and how he’s raised
cash for the Liberal Party or the Trudeau Foundation.

And now Trudeau admits to being lobbied, and lobbied often.  Usually by wealthy
donors, who paid big bucks for face time with him. Here’s some of what we know about
the Liberal cash-for-access scheme:

After meeting Trudeau, a Chinese Communist billionaire donated a large sum of cash to
the Trudeau Foundation.  Another attendee, got government approval to open a bank,
days after meeting Justin.    Since Justin became leader of the Liberal Party,
foreign donations to the Trudeau Foundation skyrocketed from $0 in 2013 to $535,000
in 2016.  Back at home, domestic donations to the Trudeau Foundation have more than
quadrupled from $172,000 to $731,000 since 2014.

Are foreign interest groups and big donors skirting the Elections Canada rules?

Are certain individuals making donations to the Trudeau Foundation, once they’ve
reached they’re legal political donation limit?

Perhaps that's a question the Ethics Commissioner can ask Trudeau.

After all, The Globe and Mail reports she will interview Justin on the matter.

In fact “It is the first time in a decade the parliament’s independent ethical
watchdog has asked a sitting Prime Minister to defend his integrity.” – Globe and
Mail, Dec 15th, 2016

The Trudeau Liberals have shown we can't trust them to keep election promises.

We can't trust them on the economy or our tax dollars.  So can anyone trust them when
it comes to their high priced fundraisers?

Help us send a message to Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party …. Enough with the
sleaze already!

437,20161217,Karen Vecchio,Keeping Communities Safe – Not a Liberal Priority,"Mike --

The Trudeau Liberals have a reputation for breaking promises.

Unfortunately, one promise they are keeping is going to put Canadians in harm’s way.

I’m talking about their dismantling of our Conservative tough on crime agenda.

They've scrapped key elements of our Victims Bill of Rights. They’re ending the
mandatory payment of the victim surcharge.

Why? To avoid any “undue hardships” to the perpetrators of crime.

That’s right, the Liberals showed more compassion to criminals, than to victims of
crime.

Then Health Minister Jane Philpott announced she is repealing our Respect for
Communities Act.

What does that mean for you and your family?

It means the Liberals are making it easier to open more drug injection sites. Making
it easier for drug addicts to get their fix.

The Liberals are ensuring that your community won’t even have a say in the matter.
Just think, a new drug injection site could be coming to your neighborhood – without
input from you or your community.

>>Stand up for safe communities – donate $50<<
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

And earlier this week, the Liberal’s Marijuana Task Force released their
recommendations on legalizing pot.

Unfortunately, they ignored the advice and recommendations of the Canadian Medical
Association, and they cast aside the warning that police do not have the tools to
keep our streets safe from increased drug impaired driving.

The Liberals are choosing to put Canadians at risk.

Dear Mike,

The Liberals want to take up to $15 billion away from rural and smaller communities.

Disagree with this approach?

If so, then the Liberals think your opinion is “stupid,” “irresponsible,” and “short-
sighted.”

The Prime Minister's Parliamentary Secretary, Adam Vaughan, actually used those words
when discussing people who don’t share the Liberal view on their new infrastructure
scheme!

Unfortunately, based on the criteria for the Liberals new “infrastructure bank”, most
rural and smaller communities across Canada won’t qualify for the Liberals’ new
infrastructure funding.

today. [https://donate.conservative.ca/help-put-canadians-

The Liberals promised their increased infrastructure spending would create jobs and
grow the economy.

In reality?

Just 1% of announced projects are actually under way.  Not one new additional full
time job has been created since the Liberals took office.  Projected deficits could
reach $130 billion over the coming years.

With results like these perhaps the Liberals need to take a look in the mirror before
calling others “irresponsible” and “short sighted”.

Short sighted is putting Canadians on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in
loans.

Irresponsible would be trying to suggest public pension funds and other capital
investors already don’t have the ability to invest in Canada right now – they do!

We need to limit the damage Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are doing. We need to
spend our tax dollars better and put people back to work.

Partnering with big pharma, trade unions, and companies with ties to Chinese

… the Liberal Party of Canada?

Close, but not quite. I’m talking about a not-for-profit think tank, called Canada
2020.

The think tank is now accused of being an extension of the Liberal Party.

Canada 2020’s president Tom Pitfield is a childhood pal of Trudeau, and was the
Liberals’ chief digital strategist during last year’s campaign.

As a happy coincidence, Pitfield’s wife is the Liberal Party’s president.

Elections Canada documents show the Liberals subleased office space from Canada 2020
during the election.

When asked for more details, Canada 2020 and the Liberal Party failed to provide a
copy of the rental agreement.

Dear Mike,

The cash spent on anti-conservative election advertising is paying off for the
government’s biggest union bosses.

The return favour? The Trudeau Liberals are putting their big union buddies ahead of
Canadian taxpayers.

In the latest round of contract negotiations, PSAC bosses and the Liberals agreed on
a new labour proposal.

The deal far exceeds anything offered in the private sector and will cost taxpayers
like you billions.

As Conservatives, we worked hard to strike the right balance when negotiating labour
agreements. It’s important to do what is fair for federal employees, while still
respecting taxpayers.

The Trudeau Liberals disagree!

This is made clear by their attempt to repay union heads for their blatant, partisan
attacks against the Conservatives in the last election.

Here is what we know so far:

Employees will see a pay hike of 5.5%;  68,000 already employed public servants will
receive a $650 “signing bonus”;   Back pay will be retroactive to the summer of 2014.

Where in the real world do sweetheart deals like this exist??

>>  Help us put taxpayers first – donate $50!
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50] <<

But that’s not all!

When in government, we tried to renegotiate a more fair system. We looked at
replacing the current sick leave model with a short term disability plan.

Currently, public servants can use 3 weeks of sick leave a year – and then bank any
unused days! So now, approximately 15 million sick days are sitting in the sick bank,
unused, and are a huge liability for taxpayers.

By replacing the sick leave banks we hoped to save tax payers from this $4 billion
liability.

The Liberals don't see it that way, instead leaving the $4 billion sick bank as-is.

It’s Canadians who are footing the bill for all this.

Union bosses campaigning for a Liberal win in the last election was an early signal
of what was to come.

As Conservatives, we are the voice of taxpayers in this country. We respect all hard-
working Canadians. And most importantly, we are not indebted to union bosses or other
special interest groups.

That’s why I’m coming to you for an end-of-year donation.

Because without your help, we wouldn’t be able to fight back against the cronyism
that exits in Ottawa today.

446,20161222,Rona Ambrose,Liberal Failures – 2016 Edition,"The Trudeau Liberals are finding out the hard way that running a country is more than
delivering platitudes and posing for selfies.

Dear Mike,

The holiday season is upon us.  So I wanted to take another moment to thank you for
your support throughout 2016.

Looking back to a year ago, our Conservative Government had left behind a balanced
budget and a blueprint to keep Canada on track.

So many of us hoped the Liberals would take advantage of this, and do right by
Canadians.

Sadly, that hope was short-lived.

The Liberals campaigned on “Real Change” and “Sunny Ways.” Ok, sure.

Just one problem: it's not working!

The Trudeau Liberals are finding out the hard way that running a country is more than
delivering platitudes and posing for selfies.

Looking back, ask yourself: have the Liberals actually accomplished anything this
year aside from tripling the deficit, introducing Trudeau’s carbon tax, and breaking
their election promises?

Fact: their first year has been the least productive in decades.

The previous five Canadian governments passed an average of 48 bills in their first
year.  Following our Conservative majority win, 58 bills received Royal Assent.

For the Liberals this year, that number sits at just 11.

But what should Canadians expect from a Prime Minister who didn’t bother to show up
for work 66% of the time? That’s right, it’s not a typo: he’s managed to attend just
18 of 53 Question Periods this past session.

Instead of being held accountable in the House of Commons, Trudeau spent his time
jet-setting around on our dime.

Why?

In a lot of cases, to attend high priced, exclusive, cash-for-access fundraisers.

Attendees include Chinese communist billionaires.  One of them made huge donations to
the Trudeau Foundation. And another got government approval to open a bank shortly
after he spoke with Trudeau. What a coincidence!

Trudeau tells us not to worry. He says the fundraisers, which raise hundreds of
thousands of dollars for the Liberal Party and the Trudeau Foundation, have no sway
on the decisions he makes.

The Ethics Commissioner disagrees.  She has expressed her ""concerns"" about the
fundraising events, and has asked for a private meeting with Trudeau to discuss the
situation.

The Lobbying Commissioner isn't buying it either.  She has opened up her own
investigation into the matter.

And a third government watchdog has opened up a separate formal investigation!  The
Federal Privacy Commissioner is looking into concerns following the catastrophic
launch of the mydecomcracy.ca survey on electoral reform.

This all adds up to one cold hard fact – Justin Trudeau may be good at taking
selfies, but he's terrible at governing.

So, while Justin Trudeau and the Liberals get up to their old tricks again, we remain
focused on defeating him in the next election!

Help us stand up for Canada and prepare for the 2019 election right now – donate $50!

448,20161223,Jeremy Hollingsworth,Hurting families like mine,"The Liberals want to take up to $15 billion away from rural and smaller communities.

Dear Mike,

I have been working for the Conservative Party for 10 years. And one of the things I
am most proud of is our record on taxes.

After taking office in 2006, we immediately lowered the GST and brought in tax breaks
for families and businesses.

In 2014, Stephen Harper rolled out another series of tax breaks and tax credits,
including income splitting for families, an increase to the Universal Child Care
Benefit, and children’s arts and fitness tax credits.

Income splitting was particularly important. People had demanded it for years, as it
righted a longstanding wrong in our tax code.

(Warning: I’m going to talk numbers here. So if a Liberal MP has somehow gotten this
email, you can just stop reading now, as you won’t like what they prove.)

Our income splitting measure allowed families to assign a portion of one spouse’s
income to the other for tax purposes.

The maximum amount that could be transferred to the other spouse was $50,000, and the
tax benefit was capped at $2,000 to prevent abuse.

In short, this measure allowed families to keep more of their own money – what a
concept!

Justin Trudeau and the Liberals never met a tax they didn’t like, so were of course
against this from the very beginning. They screamed that income splitting only
benefits the “wealthy”.

Let’s examine that claim, shall we?

Family 1 has one spouse who earns $50,000, and another spouse who also earns $50,000.
Their total household income is $100,000.  Family 2 has one spouse who earns $80,000,
and another spouse who earns $20,000. Their total household income is $100,000.
Family 3 has one spouse who earns $100,000, and another spouse who earns $0. Their
total household income is $100,000.

You’ll note that all three families have a yearly income of $100,000.

But according to Justin Trudeau, only Family 1 is “middle class”. The other two are
“wealthy” and therefore undeserving of a tax break.

Make sense to you? Me neither.

Either way, the Liberals scrapped income splitting as soon as they took office.

They also scrapped our Universal Child Care Benefit. They claimed that the difference
was made up for with their new “Canada Child Benefit” (note the loss of the word
“universal”).

One problem – the Liberals also scrapped our Children’s Arts and Fitness Tax Credits!
Which means families are worse off than before.

And, of course, there is the elephant in the room – the skyrocketing Liberal debt,
which will be paid for with their massive new carbon tax, which will drive up the
cost of everything.

See the pattern here?

Our Conservative government wanted people to keep more of their own money.

The Liberals, on the other hand, see your money as their own for the taking.

They know best! And in a world where the government knows how to spend your money
better than you do, why wouldn’t you want to hand it all over?

So what can we do? Well, the best thing we can do now is ensure that Justin Trudeau’s
damage is limited to one term only.

Part of my job is keeping an eye on what the Liberals are doing.

Over the last few weeks, they’ve sent a ton of emails. Which is normal – it is the

But what fascinates me is just how little substance there is to any of them.

In typical Liberal fashion, the emails are full of empty platitudes, and make vague
allusions to “progress” (which, from what I can tell, means a gender quota for
cabinet, a gender neutral national anthem, and a glowing remembrance of Cuban
dictator Fidel Castro).

The lack of substance speaks to their record – they’ve been in power for over a year

Christmas is upon us, so I’d like to take a moment to reflect on this past year and
say thank you so much for your support in 2016.

I hope you are able to celebrate over the coming days with friends, family and loved
ones.

I’m going to celebrate with my wife and three year old twin boys. This is the first

Conservatives - just like families - share certain values and beliefs.

We have ideas about what makes Canada the best place in the world to live. And if we

The same is true for our 14 Leadership contenders.

As we enter the new year, we are all looking forward to finding out who will lead our

It is crucial to have strong leadership heading into the 2019 election. We must make
sure Justin Trudeau is a one term Prime Minister.

But to do that, we need you to keep your memberships up to date, keep donating, and
keep volunteering.

I know we’ve been sending a lot of fundraising requests lately. But that’s because we
fundraise the honest way.

We rely on the support of the grassroots – every day Canadians, like you.

We won’t sell out government access to the highest bidder, by holding unethical
fundraisers like the Liberals.

We refuse to be beholden to special interest groups. We choose to work on behalf of
people like you.

Thanks to your generosity, we have been able to hold Justin Trudeau and the Liberals
to account.

We’ll continue to be the voice of the taxpayer, and ensure the economy, jobs, and
keeping taxes low remain a priority.

With your ongoing support, I know we’ll remain in the best position to stand up for
Canadians.

On behalf of myself, my family, and our whole CPC HQ family, Merry Christmas and

But Trudeau doesn’t share the same values as Canadians. He campaigned on running
“modest deficits.” Instead, he is on track to saddle taxpayers with more than $130
billion in new debt over the next few years.

This kind of reckless spending doesn’t sit well with the public.

According to the same survey, Canadians feel less positive about their current
financial situation.

And they’re right to feel this way!

This fall, during pre-budget consultations, the Finance Minister was clear. The
future economic picture for Canada's economy is bleak.

His department admitted that productivity is down. There have been deep declines in
energy sector investment. And household consumer debt is worse now than it was under
our Conservative government.

We’ve seen no economic or job growth this year. All the Trudeau Liberals have
delivered is promises of higher taxes. More ineffective deficit spending. And little
regard for your tax dollar.

As the Official Opposition, we’ve been working hard to stand up for Canadian
taxpayers. I’m asking you to stand alongside us.

Help us end a message to Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party that Canadians deserve
better.

Sincerely,

Hon. Kevin Sorenson

unseat Trudeau in 2019. Help us start 2017 strong!.

Dear Mike,

Happy New Year! I hope you and your family had a very Merry Christmas and enjoyed
some quality time off together.

I was busy in December, so I contacted the Party to make sure I could email you first
thing in the New Year.

I remain so grateful to you for offering the advice, donations, and votes that helped
create a strong Conservative Government platform based on common sense, sound
economic principles, and an over-arching concern for Canada’s taxpayers and working
families.

But I’m also writing to you today because I am seriously concerned for the well-being
of our great country.

The practical policies and significant accomplishments we achieved are under siege by
the Trudeau Government.

They increased federal taxes and intend to impose new ones — including Trudeau’s
Carbon Tax that will cripple economic growth, burden ordinary consumers and
taxpayers, send jobs off-shore, and undermine Canada’s ability to compete in the
world.

We’ve seen no job growth for Canadians in the prime working age group of 25 to 54.
Full-time jobs are turning into part-time jobs. And your purchasing power has been
seriously weakened.

The Trudeau Government immediately scrapped our Conservative balanced budget last
year — and now intends to recklessly mortgage Canada’s future by burdening taxpayers
with a staggering $130 billion in new federal debt over the next four years.

If that weren’t bad enough, the Liberals will also give away $2.65 billion of your
tax dollars to small foreign countries in Asia and Africa to create so-called “clean
jobs” as part of Trudeau’s “Global Climate Change Action” plan.

They are literally killing jobs in Canada while sending your money to create jobs in
other countries!

Sadly, I could go on.

Instead, let me share one immediate way you and I can team up again today to ensure
this Liberal Government is limited to just one term.

I may have stepped down from Parliament last year, but my dedication to strengthening
our Conservative Party remains strong and determined. That’s why I am volunteering my
time to serve on the board of Conservative Fund Canada, our Party’s fundraising
agent.

That means it is my job to ensure we are well prepared to fight the 2019 election.

Will you help us out with a $50 donation?
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

The Liberals are fundraising aggressively.

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, they have been aggressively seeking “double
donations” of $3,000 from corporate lobbyists and international billionaires.

They are prepared to break every ethical fundraising rule we put in place to set up
lush private cocktail events, where the wealthy and powerful who do business with the
federal government rub shoulders with the Prime Minister and top Liberal Cabinet
members and be asked to fork over the cash.

This new Liberal fundraising tactic presents us with a grave challenge. As you know,
Justin Trudeau already enjoys the free advantage of daily blind praise from the
pundits and “opinion-makers” of the left-leaning media elite. Now the Liberal Party
is also using their control of government to cash in.

Our Conservative Party relies on grassroots supporters like you.

I see huge opportunities ahead for our Conservative Party to make gains in 2017 that
can lead to victory in 2019. I hope you agree.

Please help us start the new year strong with a $50 donation today.

Annual budget deficits for the next quarter century.

466,20170112,Blaine Calkins,Trudeau’s sad cabinet shuffle,"With each passing day, the level of the Liberal incompetency continues to rise.

Dear Mike,

With each passing day, the level of Liberal incompetency continues to rise.

To divert attention away from this, Justin Trudeau decided to shuffle his cabinet.

He is hoping Canadians will forget about his unethical fundraising and abysmal record
on the economy — all while living like a Hollywood celebrity on your dime.

But Canadians are smart enough to know that a few new faces around the cabinet table
doesn’t change a thing.

Under Trudeau’s leadership, Canada is heading in the wrong direction.

He has lived a privileged life - and for most of it, he has done so on your dime.

In the past year there have been parties with rock stars, vacations at “the summer
camp for billionaires”, and over Christmas, a holiday on a private island called the
""Hamptons of the Bahamas"".

Instead of taking ten vacations in the past year, Trudeau should have been getting to
work for Canadians.

It shouldn’t be hard, but he’s only bothered to show up 18 times for Question Period
last session.

If he spent more time at work he would see his Minister’s failings are his own fault.
Bringing new-to-us faces into his inner circle won’t work.

It won’t work because the Liberals are completely out of touch with the realities of
hard-working Canadians.

Canadians need relief from high energy costs - not new carbon taxes!

They need better paying full time jobs - not “statistically insignificant"" job
growth!

With Christmas behind us, credit card bills are arriving in the mail, and Canadians
are working overtime to pay off their credit card bills.

What are the Liberals doing about their debt? Piling on even more!

So much that we can expect to see $1.5 Trillion in debt over the coming years.

Yesterday’s cabinet shuffle addresses none of these serious concerns for Canadians.

Help us kick off 2017 in the strongest way possible, as we work to be the strongest
opposition possible to fight for you.

467,20170113,Peter Kent,Cozying up to communists,"A curious move has Canadians wondering what the Trudeau Liberals are thinking.

Dear Mike,

A curious move has Canadians wondering what the Trudeau Liberals are thinking.

Back in 2015 our Conservative government blocked the sale of a Canadian electronics
firm to China’s O-Net Communications due to national security concerns.

You see, over 25% of O-Net's ownership belongs to a subsidiary of the China
Electronic Corporation.

It should be pointed out that even a minority state investment in a Chinese firm
means it is a Chinese state-controlled enterprise. Through hard experience Canada has
learned it is wrong to allow the Chinese government to own – and possibly abuse –
sensitive elements of the Canadian economy.

But, in a stunning display of ineptitude, the Liberals have reversed this decision.

This is short sighted and worrisome.

But this is nothing new. The Liberals have worked to please the Chinese at all
levels.

Trudeau has:

Offered himself up to the highest bidder at private cash for access fundraisers for
Chinese billionaires.  Seen donations to the Trudeau Foundation spike.  Given
approval for a Chinese billionaire to open banking operations in BC after making a
donation to the Liberal Party.

Canadians need to understand the risks the Liberals are taking with this decision.

China’s drive to militarize the South China Seas and the technological ramifications
after this deal goes through should have us asking for more due diligence.

Justin Trudeau is pandering to a Communist State. He says he has an “admiration” for
China because of their “basic dictatorship.”

He’s even led the charge as the Liberals rushed to negotiate an extradition treaty
with China despite their historic widespread abuse of human rights and capital
punishment.

This is setting a worrying trend - one where Trudeau is putting his personal gain and
the gain of the Liberal Party ahead of the best interests of Canadians.

Canadian security – not Chinese donations to the Liberal Party – needs to be top of
mind for this government. Donate now if you agree.

Dear Mike,

After weeks of stonewalling, details are emerging of Justin Trudeau’s unethical and
perhaps illegal “vacation”.

The Trudeau's spent the New Year on a private island called “The Hamptons of the
Bahamas” – how middleclass.

But the lack of transparency about the trip has raised alarm bells. Now Canadians and
the media are demanding answers.

Here’s what we know so far:

Liberal MP Seamus O’Regan, Liberal Party President Anna Gainey, and Canada 2020
President Tom Pitfield joined the Trudeau’s on the private island in the Bahamas.
Canada 2020, a not-for-profit think tank, has come under fire recently for its close
ties to the Liberal Party.  Section 12 of the Conflict of Interest Act says
ministers, their families, and staff cannot accept travel by private aircraft.
Trudeau has admitted he used a private helicopter to get to the island oasis – then
told the media he doesn't ""see an issue with that.”

Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, the Ethics Commissioner does see an issue with
that. She has opened up a preliminary investigation in to the matter.

This brings the total number of possible investigations into Liberal wrongdoing by
government watchdogs to four.

Trudeau has revealed he may have broken both federal laws and his own rules on
Ministerial behaviour.

Canadians deserve better. They deserve a government that doesn’t abuse its powers for
personal gain!

Trudeau’s disastrous economic policies – and now his abuse of power – must stop. We
must hold Trudeau to one term only.

existent, and the economy has stalled.

I’ll be blunt: Trudeau’s plan to stimulate the economy by spending more has failed.

Canadians deserve better!

Canadians deserve a government willing to make the hard choices necessary to ensure
prosperity in our economy.

We are the only party ready, willing, and able to keep Canada on track.

Support us, so we can fight to save the economy of tomorrow.  Donate $50 today.

472,20170119,Shannon Stubbs,... paying Trudeau’s carbon tax on WHAT?,"You won't believe this...

Dear Mike,

When the clock struck midnight New Year’s Eve, Albertans and Ontarians started to pay
more for everything.

Premiers Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne followed Justin Trudeau’s lead and
introduced their own carbon taxes - despite vocal opposition from the public.

In Ontario, drivers woke up on January 1 to see prices at the pump spike almost 5
cents a litre! Just wait until they see their hydro bills.

Those price hikes are, sadly, expected. But there are some other “items” being taxed
as well. You won’t believe this…

>> Help us fight Trudeau’s carbon tax! << [https://donate.conservative.ca/fight-the-
carbon-tax?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

There’s an old saying – “In this world nothing is certain, except death and taxes.”

Rachel Notley has managed to combine the two.

That’s right! Media reports say families in Alberta are being slapped with an added
carbon tax charge – when having their loved ones cremated.

Nice, huh?

Imagine having just said goodbye to a family member, then finding out you have to pay
an extra carbon tax fee.

And now, Trudeau wants to bring this approach to the entire country.

In fact, he is doubling down on his quest to transform Canada by adding his own
national carbon tax.

Last Friday, he said we need to ""phase out"" fossil fuels – the very resource that
fuels our economy and puts food on the table for millions of Canadians.

Decisions like this show just how out of touch he is.

Twitter responded with a hashtag - #PhaseOutTrudeau.

One thing is for certain – we need to phase out Trudeau’s carbon tax as soon as
possible!

now.  [https://donate.conservative.ca/fight-the-carbon-tax?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

473,20170120,The Hon. Peter MacKay,Asking for a favour,"I know it’s been a while. So I’m glad for this opportunity to reach out to you.

Dear Mike,

As the calendar turns to a new year, I wanted to take a moment to say hello. I know
it’s been a while. So I’m glad for this opportunity to reach out to you.

Lately, I’ve been keeping myself busy with work and family, but that hasn’t stopped
me from keeping an eye on what’s going on in Ottawa, and across the country.

2016 provided an opportunity for our Conservative Party to reflect on all of the hard
work and accomplishments we achieved during our nine years in government.

It also provided an opportunity to take its first steps towards renewing itself.

As supporters, you have stood by us while we work towards finding a new permanent
leader. You have continued to provide us with words of wisdom through your emails and
at town halls, through your generous donations, and by volunteering your time.

Without volunteers and supporters like you, the party would not be able to function.
It’s important to remember that!

As Conservatives, we are in the business of politics to serve the people, not
ourselves.

We believe in the principles of sound fiscal management, lower taxes, and doing
what’s best for everyday Canadians.

That’s why it’s more important now than ever before to hold Justin Trudeau and his
Liberals to account.

In the past year, we’ve seen what he and his cohorts are capable of. And it’s not
good!

Under our leadership, Canada weathered the world-wide economic downturn. We were one
of the first countries in the industrialized world to balance our budgets, while
still managing to cut taxes and improve social programs for seniors and all families.

Since being elected, the economic management of the Trudeau Liberals has been an
absolute train wreck.

In the near term, we already know Trudeau is taking us down the path of a whopping
$130 billion spending deficit. And now the latest projections coming out of Finance
Canada show a trajectory towards $1.5 Trillion in debt, within our lifetime!

This is a trend that simply can’t continue.

We already know Trudeau and his cabinet can’t be trusted to make decisions that are
in the best interests of Canadians.

Based on the number of investigations into Trudeau’s fundraising schemes, it appears
he can’t even be trusted to make the best decisions for himself!

It is crucial - for the good of our country! - to make sure Justin Trudeau is held to
just one term as Prime Minister.

With each day that passes we are getting closer to electing a new leader. A leader
who will work to defeat Trudeau in 2019.

But to do this, we need your help now.

Join us as we work to bring common sense and decency back to Ottawa.

We need to start the new year strong. Will you help with a donation today?

Dear Mike,

Here we go again!

Last fall, I told you Trudeau’s Liberals were considering a new digital tax on
everything.

Now government briefing documents show they may be moving forward with their plans.

On the heels of their $1.5 trillion deficit projection, Trudeau’s Liberals are
scrambling for ways to pay for it.

And their best solution is to make Canadians pay more for the internet and streaming
services like Netflix!

Canadians aren’t happy about it, with tens of thousands of people signing our
petition against it.

Liberals call an internet tax increase for consumers as a commitment to tax
“fairness”. But fairness to who?

Trudeau plans to run trillion-dollar deficits for the next quarter century. Where is
his “fairness” to taxpayers?

We Conservatives are the only ones fighting the Liberals on behalf of Canadian
consumers. We believe Canadians should be able to watch Netflix and use the internet
without having to pay more.

477,20170126,Hon. Diane Finley,Trudeau’s sad attempt to change the channel,"How gullible do the Trudeau Liberals think we are?

Dear Mike,

How gullible do the Trudeau Liberals think we are?

For weeks Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been hammered over his unethical – and
according to at least one newspaper, possibly even illegal - behaviour.

Exclusive cash for access fundraisers, cutting deals with Chinese communist
billionaires, and now a beach vacation on a private island in the Bahamas – with a
free private helicopter ride to boot.

Why is this so bad?

Because Trudeau likely violated the Conflict of Interest Act!

The Ethics Commissioner has opened an investigation into the matter - the first-ever
investigation into a sitting Prime Minister for political wrongdoing.

Naturally, Trudeau tried to change the channel by embarking on a cross-country tour
to “reconnect” with Canadians.

Reconnect? That didn’t take the Liberals long - hit a bump in the road, send Trudeau
out on a nationwide selfie tour.

Trudeau faced tough questions during his Ontario leg of the tour: accusations of not
doing enough to help veterans; creating a generation of Canadians who live in energy
poverty - thanks to his carbon tax.

In London, a student named Zack asked Trudeau the following question:

“What, if anything, are you going to do to curb your insane and reckless spending
habits?”

The answer, like all answers before, followed Trudeau’s usual formula. Thank the
person for the question, and then do your best to ignore it.

Why go on a tour that doesn’t answer anyone’s questions?

This tour is about perception.

The Liberals believe that Canadians will just be grateful that Justin took the time
to show up.

Trudeau is hoping that just showing up will earn him a participation ribbon from the
public.

Canadians shouldn’t be fooled. Shaking hands, kissing babies, and delivering the same
talking points over and over again doesn’t help everyday Canadians.

It doesn’t change the fact that he is bringing in a massive new carbon tax that will
drive up the cost of everything.

And it sure doesn’t change the fact that Trudeau is saddling the next generation, and
the one after that, with trillions of dollars of new debt.

Tell Trudeau that he isn’t fooling anyone. Help us deliver the message with a
donation today. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

Dear Mike,

So much for helping the middle class.

For years now, Justin Trudeau has preached the virtues of his commitment to the
middle class, and we’ve said all along it’s nothing more than window dressing. Anyone
that takes a closer inspection of his policy decisions will see that it’s all talk.

The Liberal government is readying to bring in a blatant $3 billion tax grab – from
the middle class!!

Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau are looking at new ways of taxing middle-
income earners to pay for their massive spending addiction, and now appear set to tax
health and dental benefit plans!

This includes dental, vision care and prescription drug plans.

Help us fight these out of control tax hikes –  Donate $50 today.
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

Medical professionals, along with their patients, have been lobbying the Finance
Minister and MPs about what a disaster this would be. One report even stated that up
to 13.5 million hard working Canadians will have to pay for this latest Trudeau tax
grab.

Individuals who earn $45,000 could expect to hand over an extra $1000 per year in new
taxes. Costs would double in a two income family with similar coverage.

Trudeau talks about tax fairness for the middle class, but all he has done is make it
more fair for people like him.

He’s eliminated the Universal Child Care Benefit  He’s eliminated the Children’s Arts
Tax Credit  He’s eliminated the Children’s Fitness Tax Credit  He’s introducing a
Carbon Tax on Everything

And now, if you or your loved ones get sick, Trudeau wants you to pay for it.

Help us send a clear message to the Liberals to leave our health benefits alone.

As Canadians we are proud of our country. We are proud of our heritage, and we have a
sense of community.

In the Conservative family these same feelings exist.

I and many of my colleagues have left Parliament Hill, but it doesn’t mean we have
stopped being a part of the family.

As a former Party leader, I will always look to the Conservative Party as something
to be proud of. It is something I will always care about.

I am proud to have been part of the team that helped unite the right. Today I remain
invested and involved. In fact, I consider it a civic duty!

It feels like just yesterday that Canadians gave our Conservative Party its first
chance to govern the country.

It’s hard to believe that last month we celebrated the 11th anniversary of that
election victory!

During our time in government, I was proud to be a member of cabinet, serving you in
any way possible.

Following the 2011 election, I watched my friend Prime Minister Harper lead Canada
through unprecedented economic times.

Balanced budgets! Lower taxes! A strong stable economy! All were all delivered by our
government.

Things didn’t go our way in 2015, but that presented us with a new opportunity and
exciting challenges. Which of course brings us to the leadership race.

I know all too well nothing invigorates our supporters like a good, healthy,
thoughtful debate. And that is exactly what this leadership race has provided so far.

Our new leader will take over in May.

We must remain the strong, united and focused Official Opposition Canadians deserve.

What I have seen so far from Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party worries me.

For those old enough to remember, Pierre Trudeau did irreparable economic damage to
Canada. Damage that has taken decades to repair. Based on the choices made by Justin
Trudeau, it looks like he is taking us down the same destructive path.

Canadians always look for ways to improve their lives and dream of providing a better
future for their families.

Justin Trudeau's policies are making these dreams harder to come true.

The projected annual debt levels during Trudeau’s first mandate will be close to $130
billion.

Taxes are going up for families and business. And the Trudeau Liberals are under
investigation by four separate independent government watchdogs!

That’s not true leadership. Canadians deserve better.

I commend the amazing work of my former cabinet colleague Rona Ambrose. Her time as
the interim leader of the Party has been invaluable. I thank her from the bottom of
my heart for her service.

And I am sure when a permanent leader is in place, our party will continue the good
work Rona has begun in opposition.

We will remain united and prove to be effective as the opposition. We will hold
Justin and his party accountable. We will continue to propose ways to help honest,
hard-working Canadians and their families.

And I am convinced that in 2019, we will once again form government. That work, of
course, starts now.

483,20170209,Rona Ambrose,🚨🚨🚨 CORPORATE BAILOUT ALERT 🚨🚨🚨,"Once again, the Trudeau Liberals are back to spending your money like it was their
own to give away.

Dear Mike,

Once again, the Trudeau Liberals are spending your money like it is their own to give
away.

This time, they’re handing out $327 million of your hard earned tax dollars to
Bombardier.

We can all agree Bombardier is a world class leader in its field.

In fact, business is booming. Orders for the company have picked up significantly in
recent months.

That's what makes this decision so puzzling. Why bail them out when Bombardier
already said last year that they don't even need the money?

“We have secured all the funding required to ramp up the CSeries program and also for
the rest of aerospace. Really, the federal funding would just be … an extra bonus
that would be helpful but is very clearly not required.”

Rob Dewar, vice-president of Bombardier

As the voice of taxpayers, we have serious concerns about this handout. Bombardier
still has outstanding government loans which have yet to be fully repaid!

Help us fight these corporate handouts - Donate $50 now!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50]

Governments should be in the business of creating a job friendly environment.
Lowering taxes and cutting red tape is a good start.

Instead, the Trudeau Liberals prefer to pick winners and losers. They give away
billions in unnecessary taxpayer handouts, and leave ordinary Canadians with the tab.

Let’s be honest – that’s what is really happening here.

Justin Trudeau is handing a giant corporation another $327 million of your money with
one hand, and then forcing you to pay for it via a massive new carbon tax with the
other hand.

He is making life easier for multi-billion dollar corporations, while making life
harder for ordinary taxpayers.

And once fully implemented, his carbon tax will make our industries less competitive
in the North American marketplace!

He is putting our businesses at a serious economic disadvantage, while costing
Canadians more.

Explain to me again how this makes any sense at all…?!

We must stop this madness. The fight to replace Justin Trudeau and the Liberals
starts NOW.

Do your part and help us continue our strong start to 2017 with a $50 donation today.

484,20170210,Tony Clement,We told them so!,"Much has been said about Justin Trudeau over the last few weeks - most of it
negative.

Dear Mike,

Much has been said about Justin Trudeau over the last few weeks - most of it
negative.

Mocked by prominent world leaders for his close ties to communism.  Investigations
for unethical and possibly illegal behaviour, by FOUR separate government watchdogs.
Criticism from economists for charting a path towards trillion dollar deficits.

And now, by scrapping his electoral reform plans, he has broken yet another promise
he campaigned on.

Those who put their faith in Justin Trudeau are feeling cheated right now. And his
poll numbers are down to show it.

It looks like the Trudeau honeymoon is coming to an end.

Canadians are finally waking up to the fact that Justin Trudeau isn’t who he pretends
to be. Underneath the surface, he’s just another Liberal politician.

Since becoming leader of the Liberal Party, Trudeau has been put on a pedestal,
fawned over for his celebrity-like appeal.

Many Canadians voted with a true belief in their hearts that Justin was different. A
politician like no other, and one that does what he says.

In 16 months Trudeau has proven he lives by the motto: do as I say, not as I do.

He ignores his own ethical rules.

He spends more time hanging out with lobbyists at Liberal cash-for-access fundraisers
than showing up to the House of Commons to do his job.

Most importantly, he has failed to deliver tangible policy initiatives to keep the
economy strong.

Case in point: Trudeau's campaign promise of increased infrastructure spending. The
PBO says the plan is far from transparent and rapidly falling behind schedule.

When the cameras are on, Trudeau delivers platitudes. He tells people what he thinks
they want to hear. He’ll make promises to do better.

But once the cameras are off, the public are left hanging. Like they were with every
Liberal politician before Justin Trudeau.

For over a year Canadians have waited for action and results.

This was never more evident than during his recent town hall tour. Those in
attendance began to see through his façade.

Don’t believe me? Well, the proof is in the pudding. In a recent Ipsos poll, 52% of
those surveyed called Trudeau’s tour a “total waste of money”. And more than 50%
agree his tour was orchestrated to distract the public from the terrible job he is
doing!

Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way forever.

Right now our Conservative Party is running an exciting leadership campaign. The end
result will be a new permanent leader who will defeat Justin Trudeau and become the
next Prime Minister of Canada.

We have to begin the hard work to defeat Justin Trudeau now.

Seriously – we need to. For the good of our country, and the next generation of
Canadians.

Dear Mike,

It’s been quite an upsetting start to 2017.

But this upsets me the most:

Under Trudeau’s leadership, the Liberals are abandoning our soldiers serving
overseas. They are actually going to take away tax benefits that provide $1500 to
$1800 a month for Canadian troops fighting ISIS!

That’s right, the Liberals manage to find money for limo rides and moving expenses.
They find cash for million dollar office renovations, glamour photo shoots in Paris,
and manage to spend $900 a night to stay at the ""Summer Camp for Billionaires"".

It is despicable they would choose to pinch pennies on the backs of the hard working
men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces.

But it doesn’t stop there!

The Liberals are under investigation by four separate government watchdogs for
illicit behaviour. Their polling numbers continue to slide.

Canadians are wary. Broken promises and unpopular policy decisions have left voters
confused and fed up.

Despite his ever deepening debt load, Trudeau continues to waste your tax dollars as
he sees fit.

Most recently, his bailout of Bombardier, the multi-billion dollar corporation.
Headquartered in Trudeau’s hometown of Montreal, they said the money was ""not
required.” But Trudeau handed then $372 million of your money anyway.

With a slew of new tax grabs on the way, it seems Trudeau has finally realized
someone has to pay for his pet projects.

Spoiler: that someone is you!

Despite serious opposition, Trudeau is ready to install his carbon tax.

And with Budget 2017 just around the corner, Trudeau is desperate to find even more
new ways to finance his fanciful spending habits.

There is the anticipated taxing of your health and dental benefits. We called on the
Liberal government to support our motion; ""to abandon any plans it may have to in any
way tax health and dental plans.” They refused and actually voted against the motion.

Next up, a hike to the price you pay for government services. They use fancy terms
like “modernizing user fees.” The reality is, this will increase the cost of
interacting with the government in every feasible way.

This madness has to stop!

We’re running an exciting leadership race that will see the election of a new
permanent leader who will stop Justin Trudeau and the Liberals in 2019.

We will bring respect for taxpayers and our military back to Ottawa!

487,20170216,Dan Albas,Medical wait times about to get longer – thanks to the Liberal Party,"Longer medical wait times can put your health at risk - but the Liberals don’t seem
to care.

Dear Mike,

Longer medical wait times can put your health at risk - but the Liberals don’t seem
to care.

That’s the message from Finance Minister Bill Morneau.

After tripling the deficit with nothing to show for it, the Liberals are looking at
ways to generate more tax revenue for their pet projects.

To pay for their largesse, the Liberals have said they are hiking user fees and they
will take away more tax credits that Canadians depend on.

And they’re bringing in a huge carbon tax that will drive up the cost of everything.

Their next plan of attack on Canada’s health care system? To force doctors into
paying tens of thousands more in taxes.

Medical professionals say the Liberals’ new tax code changes could lead to thousands
of medical specialists moving to the States.

The medical community made an aggressive push to reverse the changes. Emails were
sent and meeting requests made, but it was all for nothing.

Don’t just take our word for it. Ray Foley, the Executive Director of the Ontario
Association of Radiologists, was quoted as saying: “physicians will leave the country
because they’ll see Canada as not very attractive.”

John Feeley, Vice President of the Canadians Medical Association said he was “very
disappointed” with the Finance Minister.

The Liberals are taking the wrong approach to cover for their out-of-control spending
habits. Doctors – and, more importantly, patients – shouldn’t pay the price for
Liberal incompetence.

Help us stop the Liberals from putting health care at risk. Donate today.

Dear Mike,

As Conservatives we are proud to stand up for law-abiding Canadians.

That is why we took a tough stance on behalf of victims of crime. That included
bringing in mandatory minimum sentences for the worst of criminal offenders.

The Liberals, on the other hand, have been quite clear - they intend to undo as many
of our accomplishments as possible.

And they’re starting with the elimination of mandatory jail time. Justin Trudeau’s
Justice Minister has already started the dismantling.

She has directed her department to go through the Criminal Code with a fine tooth
comb, and we know their target is any of the progress our Conservative government
made in putting victims first.

But is this really the right action to take?

Just last week Vincent Li – the man convicted of brutally murdering another passenger
on a bus not even 10 years ago – received an absolute discharge with no conditions or
monitoring!

At a time like this, shouldn’t the Liberals be more focused on taking steps to keep
Canadians safe?

489,20170222,Stockwell Day,"It's a lack of Liberal leadership, Mike","Canadians deserve better.

Dear Mike,

Thanks for taking the time to read this email.

As Canadians we are proud of our country. We are proud of our heritage, and we have a
sense of community.

In the Conservative family these same feelings exist.

I and many of my colleagues have left Parliament Hill, but it doesn’t mean we have
stopped being a part of the family.

As a former Party leader, I will always look to the Conservative Party as something
to be proud of. It is something I will always care about.

I am proud to have been part of the team that helped unite the right. Today I remain
invested and involved. In fact, I consider it a civic duty!

It feels like just yesterday that Canadians gave our Conservative Party its first
chance to govern the country.

It’s hard to believe that last month we celebrated the 11th anniversary of that
election victory!

During our time in government, I was proud to be a member of cabinet, serving you in
any way possible.

Following the 2011 election, I watched my friend Prime Minister Harper lead Canada
through unprecedented economic times.

Balanced budgets! Lower taxes! A strong stable economy! All were all delivered by our
government.

Things didn’t go our way in 2015, but that presented us with a new opportunity and
exciting challenges. Which of course brings us to the leadership race.

I know all too well nothing invigorates our supporters like a good, healthy,
thoughtful debate. And that is exactly what this leadership race has provided so far.

Our new leader will take over in May.

We must remain the strong, united and focused Official Opposition Canadians deserve.

What I have seen so far from Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party worries me.

For those old enough to remember, Pierre Trudeau did irreparable economic damage to
Canada. Damage that has taken decades to repair. Based on the choices made by Justin
Trudeau, it looks like he is taking us down the same destructive path.

Canadians always look for ways to improve their lives and dream of providing a better
future for their families.

Justin Trudeau's policies are making these dreams harder to come true.

The projected annual debt levels during Trudeau’s first mandate will be close to $130
billion.

Taxes are going up for families and business. And the Trudeau Liberals are under
investigation by four separate independent government watchdogs!

That’s not true leadership. Canadians deserve better.

I commend the amazing work of my former cabinet colleague Rona Ambrose. Her time as
the interim leader of the Party has been invaluable. I thank her from the bottom of
my heart for her service.

And I am sure when a permanent leader is in place, our party will continue the good
work Rona has begun in opposition.

We will remain united and prove to be effective as the opposition. We will hold
Justin and his party accountable. We will continue to propose ways to help honest,
hard-working Canadians and their families.

And I am convinced that in 2019, we will once again form government. That work, of
course, starts now.

Dear Mike,

I wanted to take a moment to say hello. I know it’s been a while, so I’m glad for
this opportunity to reach out to you.

Lately, I’ve been keeping myself busy with work and family, but that hasn’t stopped
me from keeping an eye on what’s going on in Ottawa, and across the country.

2016 provided an opportunity for our Conservative Party to reflect on all of the hard
work and accomplishments we achieved during our nine years in government.

It also provided an opportunity to take its first steps towards renewing itself.

As supporters, you have stood by us while we work towards finding a new permanent
leader. You have continued to provide us with words of wisdom through your emails and
at town halls, through your generous donations, and by volunteering your time.

Without volunteers and supporters like you, the party would not be able to function.
It’s important to remember that!

As Conservatives, we are in the business of politics to serve the people, not
ourselves.

We believe in the principles of sound fiscal management, lower taxes, and doing
what’s best for everyday Canadians.

That’s why it’s more important now than ever before to hold Justin Trudeau and his
Liberals to account.

In the past year, we’ve seen what he and his cohorts are capable of. And it’s not
good!

Under our leadership, Canada weathered the world-wide economic downturn. We were one
of the first countries in the industrialized world to balance our budgets, while
still managing to cut taxes and improve social programs for seniors and all families.

Since being elected, the economic management of the Trudeau Liberals has been an
absolute train wreck.

In the near term, we already know Trudeau is taking us down the path of a whopping
$130 billion spending deficit. And now the latest projections coming out of Finance
Canada show a trajectory towards $1.5 Trillion in debt, within our lifetime!

This is a trend that simply can’t continue.

We already know Trudeau and his cabinet can’t be trusted to make decisions that are
in the best interests of Canadians.

Based on the number of investigations into Trudeau’s fundraising schemes, it appears
he can’t even be trusted to make the best decisions for himself!

It is crucial - for the good of our country! - to make sure Justin Trudeau is held to
just one term as Prime Minister.

With each day that passes we are getting closer to electing a new leader. A leader
who will work to defeat Trudeau in 2019.

But to do this, we need your help now.

Join us as we work to bring common sense and decency back to Ottawa.

We need to start the new year strong. Will you help with a donation today?

Dear Mike,

Following his insensitive behaviour, Justin Trudeau has finally issued a public
apology... more than a month after the incident!

At a town hall in Sherbrooke, Quebec, a woman asked if the government could help
Anglophones in Quebec find better mental health services. This is an as issue for
many, as most mental health services in Quebec are only available in French.

Trudeau refused to answer in English, despite the woman asking in English. He chose
to answer in French instead.

The end result: an investigation by the Official Languages Commissioner, public
condemnation, and now Trudeau’s public apology.

Trudeau was able to easily answer the very important question in the woman’s language
of choice. His failure to do so showed a complete lack of respect and leadership.

499,20170307,Kevin Sorenson,Bad Decisions Lead to Severe Consequences,"Dear Mike,

Keeping Canadians safe. Fostering an environment for a strong, stable economy.

Those should be considered top priorities for any government.

As Minister of State for Finance, I was proud to work alongside the Hon. Jim Flaherty
and the Hon. Joe Oliver.

During that time together we accomplished many things. Major credit rating agencies
consistently affirmed Canada’s AAA credit rating. There was recognition for our
“track record of prudent fiscal management.”

Under our Conservative government:

Canada’s banking system was ranked the worlds soundest for seven years in a row.
Following the recession our GDP rose above pre-recession levels. The best performance
in the G-7.  We recouped all our lost economic output and created more jobs than were
lost during the recession.  On Bloomberg’s list of most attractive destinations to do
business, Canada ranked 2nd, beating out every other G-20 nation.

At a time when the global economy remained uncertain, Canada was an island of
stability.

Fast forward to today and it’s a different story. Justin Trudeau's fiscal
mismanagement has others sounding alarm bells.

Trudeau’s massive deficits and plans to raise taxes mean that Canada’s AAA rating may
be at risk!

>> Stop Trudeau and the Liberals from ruining our economy <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/]

And of course Trudeau is oblivious on how to handle economic matters with our largest
trading partner, the United States.

As Conservatives, we know it doesn’t make sense to continue to pursue Trudeau’s job
killing carbon tax plan.

It is a plan that will put our entire economy at an economic disadvantage compared to
the U.S. and other nations that have no such plan in place.

We must stop Trudeau from ruining our economy. Please do your part and help us
prepare for 2019 now.

Sincerely,

Keven Sorenson

500,20170308,Conservative Party of Canada,Erasing our Legacy,"Dear Mike,

It didn’t long for the Liberals to attack our Conservative legacy.

They have undone our hard work to balance the budget.  They eliminated our Family Tax
Cut, raising taxes in the process.  They are undoing the Fair Elections Act,
reversing sensible changes made to how elections are conducted in Canada.  They
eliminated the Prime Minister’s Volunteer Awards, created by Stephen Harper.

And now, in another petty display of partisanship, the Trudeau Liberals refuse to
hand out an award that recognizes the hard work of those fighting for human rights
and freedoms.

Why?

Because the award is named after a much respected Conservative Prime Minister, John
Diefenbaker.

And how do we know this is a partisan political decision?

Because a memo prepared by the public service suggests the Trudeau Liberals continue
presenting the award in some form.

Opposing our previous legislation and dismantling programs that recognize citizens
looking to make the world a better place is petty and spiteful.

It also makes for bad policy.

We’re fighting to bring a common sense and decency back to Parliament Hill.  Help us
set the course for victory in 2019 with a donation today.

501,20170310,Peter Van Loan,More broken promises,"The Trudeau Liberals will say whatever it takes to get elected. But when it comes
down to it, they cannot be trusted.

Dear Mike,

Here we go again. The Trudeau Liberals are saying one thing, but doing the complete
opposite.

Five by-elections are around the corner, with nomination contests just finished. And
of course the Trudeau Liberals are up to their old tricks.

Playing favourites is nothing new for Justin Trudeau and his Liberal gang. And we’re
watching the same movie play in ridings outside Toronto and Montreal.

We've already seen they will do whatever it takes to pick Justin’s preferred
candidate. Last time, it was Andrew Leslie, a personal advisor to Trudeau.

Leslie's nomination made national headlines. There were accusations of an
undemocratic acclamation. Police were in attendance at the nomination meeting. Folks
ripped up their membership cards in disgust.

Why? Because the Liberal Party of Canada disqualified Leslie's only challenger,
paving Leslie’s way to an easy victory.

Trudeau claims all Liberal nominations are “open nominations”. But that’s simply not
true.

Look no further than Markham-Thornhill and Saint-Laurent.

In Markham, the Liberals disqualified a whole slew of new members from voting in a
move to give Trudeau’s advisor from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) the nomination.

Now, in Montreal, the Liberals disqualified a long-time mayor from running. His
candidacy was denied without even an explanation.

Why does this matter to you? Because Justin Trudeau is running his party exactly like
he’s running government.

The Liberals continue to preach one thing to the public, then do the complete
opposite when they think no one is paying attention.

“Open nominations” that are really just favours being returned to PMO loyalists.
Balanced budgets pushed aside in favour of long-term deficits.  Tax cuts replaced
with tax hikes.

The Trudeau Liberals will say whatever it takes to get elected. But when it comes
down to it, they cannot be trusted.

With 5 by-elections coming up on April 3rd, we need your help to defeat Justin
Trudeau’s hand-picked candidates and bring respect back to the democratic process.

Dear Mike,

If there’s one thing Liberals love more than taxing you, it’s avoiding hard work and
dodging accountability.

That’s why we’re not surprised Justin Trudeau wants to re-write the rules of
Parliament to give himself Fridays off, and avoid getting asked the tough questions
we as Conservatives ask him every day.

That’s right, let me be clear: the Liberals want to take Fridays off and Justin
Trudeau only wants to show up for Question Period once a week – when the house is
sitting!

Worse, Trudeau and his crew waited until late on a Friday afternoon to release their
plan in the hopes you wouldn’t notice.

It’s obvious they just can’t be bothered showing up for work in the House of Commons
– and hate being accountable to Parliament.

On the heels of missing almost two-thirds of Question Periods in his first year as
Prime Minister, does anyone actually think Justin Trudeau should be taking even more
time off work?

Dear Mike,

A few weeks ago, the Liberals announced they were abandoning some of the brave men
and women serving in the Canadian Armed Forces.

Their plan? To eliminate tax benefits that provide $1500 to $1800 a month to Canadian
soldiers who put their lives on the line fighting ISIS.

Since then we’ve fought for the restoration of those tax benefits.

And I have good news: it’s working!

After weeks of pressure from your Conservative team, the Trudeau Liberals are backing
down.

In an about face, the Liberals have said some troops will now get the tax break back.

This move was made following our motion in the House of Commons to give the money
back.

Unfortunately, some other troops are still being left out in the cold. Media are
reporting that troops deployed after January are not entitled to the tax break.

We also still don’t know what Trudeau intends to do regarding the approximately 300
Canadians serving at a 2nd base in Kuwait who are due to have their tax break taken
away in June.

Our Party believes anyone willing to go to the Middle East and put their lives on the
line fighting ISIS deserves their full hardship pay and benefits.

Trudeau’s decision to pinch pennies on the back of our military is despicable.

509,20170321,Michelle Rempel,Trudeau putting lives at risk,"Dear Mike,

In 2009, our Conservative government introduced the Visa policy to stop the flow of
increased bogus refugee claims by Mexican citizens.

But in late 2016, the Trudeau Liberals reversed that decision.

This was an early Christmas gift for Mexico’s drug cartels.

A Canada Border Serves Agency report says lifting the visa makes it easier for
Mexican drug cartels to do business right here in Canada:

“In the next three years, Mexican drug cartels are expected to expand their presence
in Canada by sending operatives and recruiting local airport or marine port workers
with ties to Mexico,” the report states.

In other words, Justin Trudeau has put the lives of all Canadians at greater risk.

With the lifting of this Visa policy, Canada has now been forced into combating an
onslaught of new asylum seekers.

The Canadian Border Services Agency has already detained almost 450 Mexican migrants
this year. That number is already higher than the entire total for all of last year.

And when asked about what actions the Government intends to take, Trudeau’s
Immigration Minister said “it would be premature to speculate.”

>> Help us protect Canada’s borders <<  [https://donate.conservative.ca/]

Fact: there was no formal review of the Mexican visa policy reversal.

The decision to lift the visa requirement is short sighted and poorly thought out.

And it also comes with a hefty price tag. Canadians could be on the hook for hundreds
of millions of dollars in the coming years to cover the costs of this decision.

It is clear that Justin Trudeau’s only policy goal is to undo the hard work of the
Conservatives.

Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau will unveil his second budget later today, but there are TWO things
you might have missed, and I wanted to share them with you.

NUMBER ONE:

Remember Justin Trudeau’s holiday trip to a private island known as the “Hamptons of
the Bahamas”? Hosted by the head of a foundation that receives millions of dollars
from the Trudeau government? The trip that is under investigation by the Ethics
Commissioner?

We now know how much it cost taxpayers!

Trudeau’s “vacation” has cost you $127,000.

Over $71,000 to cover RCMP overtime and other affiliated costs.  Over $33,000 for the
use of the Challenger  Over $12,000 for the services of a “tour technician” –
whatever that is.

And over $15,000 billed to you, the taxpayer, to cover the costs of staff.

What, you don’t bring personal staff on your private family vacations?

>> This taxpayer abuse needs to end! The fight for 2019 starts here! <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/]

NUMBER TWO:

We have also just learned that Embassies and Consulates around the world are spending
your tax dollars to purchase… wait for it… cardboard cut-outs of Justin Trudeau to
display at parties and other events.

I wish I was making this up.

But it’s true.

Justin Trudeau – the selfie king, the PM whose government spent thousands on
glamourous photo shoots in Paris, the PM who puts vanity above everything else – is
literally having life-size cardboard cut-outs of himself sent around the world.

Mike, Canadians deserve better. They deserve serious leadership.

Soon, we’re going to have a new leader. And that new leader is going to replace
Justin Trudeau in 2019.

But that won’t happen without your help.

ideas.

Dear Mike,

The Liberals say they represent the middle class.

But based on yesterday’s budget, nothing could be further from the truth.

Here is a snapshot of the reaction:

“The payroll budgets of every business and the take home pay for Canadian workers
will now drop for 6 straight years, with an EI hike in 2018 and 5 years of CPP
premium hikes starting in 2019.”

- CFIB – Dan Kelly, President

“More urgency is needed in reducing business costs and improving competitiveness.”

- Canadian Chamber of Commerce

“No money, no ideas, but a wealth of bafflegab and buzzwords from the Liberals.”

- Andrew Coyne

“With the federal budget, the Liberals have let the middle class down, again.”

- Stephen Gordon

“Federal Budget 2017 proves Liberal plan is failing”

- Toronto Sun

“Disappointed by the absence in Budget 2017 of a more focused strategy to encourage
new business investment, attract international capital and enhance Canada’s ability
to compete in the global economy.”

- John Manley, President and CEO of the Business Council of Canada

Justin Trudeau could have offered lower taxes and presented a job creation plan that
works for Canadians.

Instead he left you with a new $28.5 billion deficit, higher taxes, and fewer tax
breaks.

Canadians are getting nickel-and-dimed so Trudeau can continue to fund his flawed
ideas.

But we have good news – there are five by-elections happening TODAY!

If you live in any of the following ridings:

Calgary Midnapore  Calgary Heritage  Markham-Thornhill  Ottawa-Vanier  Saint-Laurent

You can cast a ballot for your local Conservative candidate and stand up to the
Trudeau Liberals today.

By doing so, you’ll let the Trudeau Liberals know you are fed up with their broken
promises and mismanagement of the economy.

Get candidate and voting information  here
[http://www.conservative.ca/byelection/en]!

Regardless of what riding you may live in, you deserve better than what the Liberals
have delivered over the past 18 months.

Last month’s budget delivered another $28.5 billion in new debt, drove up taxes for
transit and Uber users, and made drinking beer and wine more expensive.

This is in advance of Trudeau’s carbon tax that will make everything more expensive,
while making our economy weaker.

If you don’t live in a by-election riding, you can still help us stop Justin Trudeau
and the Liberals with a donation today.

Thank you for your support!

518,20170405,Dustin van Vugt,Keeping up the momentum,"Dear Mike:

Join me in offering congratulations to our newest Conservative Party MP’s Bob Benzen
and Stephanie Kusie for their big by-election wins last night!

Both won by not just improving on our last election results, but claiming over 70% of
the vote in their ridings!

I’d also like to acknowledge the great efforts by our other candidates, Adrian
Papara, Ragavan Paranchothy, and Jimmy Yu.

The hard work, long hours, and dedication each of our candidates put into their
campaigns shows our Conservative Party is as strong as ever.

>> But we have to keep the momentum going!! <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

The strong showing last night by Conservatives is just another reminder that Trudeau
Liberal policies are not working and Canadians are noticing.

The Liberal vote went down in all five ridings that were up for grabs yesterday.

Traditional Liberal seats like Markham-Thornhill saw Liberal support drop
significantly while our party saw significant gains – especially compared to the last
election just 18 months ago.

But we can’t rest!

With each passing day, we get closer to electing the new permanent Conservative Party
leader.  And we must ensure our new leader is able to hit the ground running.

I know Bob and Stephanie are eager to get to work here in Ottawa and I look forward
to welcoming them.  Their victories and our momentum going forward are thanks to
supporters like you!

Last night was a big win for us –  help us set the course towards a much bigger

519,20170406,Cory Hann,Following up,"Dear Mike:

After months of stonewalling, details of Justin Trudeau’s vacation on a private
island known as “The Hamptons of the Bahamas” are beginning to emerge.

Here’s what we know so far:

Trudeau’s “family vacation” actually included fellow MP’s and the Liberal Party
President, along with spouses, staff members and a “tour technician” – whatever that
is.  Trudeau’s actions during the vacation may have broken Parliamentary Law –
resulting in an investigation by the Ethics Commission.  Costs for the trip exceeded
$127,000 – paid for by the taxpayer!!

And now we’ve found out Trudeau’s host – a well-known billionaire philanthropist –
was reimbursed thousands in tax dollars directly because of the Prime Minister’s
trip.

That’s right, Trudeau’s billionaire host – the owner of a private island in the
Bahamas whose foundation receives millions of dollars in taxpayer funding – also
received tax dollars just for hosting the Trudeau entourage.

Even the CBC is skeptical!

""Accepting meals and accommodation from someone who has a foundation that gets
government grants and which lobbies government officials raises ethical questions.
However, reimbursing the costs means that taxpayer's money went to a friend of
Trudeau's family.""

- CBC.ca, April 4, 2017

This is completely unacceptable.

We need to ensure Justin Trudeau’s Liberals are held to one term only.

520,20170407,Kevin Sorenson,Another tax hike coming your way,"Dear Mike,

Canada’s retirement system is the envy of the world.

Under the Conservatives, senior’s poverty dropped significantly as Canadians saved
for retirement.

But that isn’t stopping the Liberals from imposing a CPP tax hike on Canadians.

Why do the Liberals think they know how to spend your money better than you do?

Unfortunately, this CPP tax hike will have serious ramifications:

Taking money from the pay cheques of hardworking Canadians will put thousands of jobs
at risk.  Companies will struggle to create jobs and give workers raises, as they try
to match increased CPP premiums.  Some households will pay up to $2,200 more per year
in premiums.  With less savings, younger Canadians will have a harder time paying off
student loans or buying their first home.  For families, it will be harder to save
for vacations or their children’s post-secondary education.

We believe Canadians should be able to manage their own money.

Do you agree? [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

With long term economic projections of annual deficits for the next 25 years,
Canadians can’t trust the Liberal government with their pensions.

They haven’t been able to keep promises they made a year ago, let alone decades from
now.

Help us as we continue to get this important message out.

Since Trudeau’s 2017 Budget was announced, we have been inundated with calls, letters
and emails.

Canadians from coast to coast are upset.

In fact, “just 10% of Canadians believe Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent budget
will help the middle class,"" according to a recent poll by Forum Research.

Here is just a small sample of what we’re hearing:

""All I see in this Liberal budget is reckless management of the country's debt."" -
Christine in BC

""I am not aware of anything he has done right for average Canadians."" - Yaakov in
Quebec

""This budget is nothing useful for everyday Canadians."" - Rosemary in BC

""Canadians no longer have any trust, faith or support for this train wreck."" - Ina in
Alberta

""Time for the Liberals to go"" - James in Ontario

""Not impressed with the Liberal government at all. Can hardly make ends meet as it is
and more taxes will just make it even harder."" - Pat in Ontario

Many in the media classified the Budget as “much ado about nothing.”

Nothing could be further from the truth.

This week, we are going to explain to you how the Trudeau Liberals’ “nothing” budget
is negatively impacting Canadian families, seniors, troops and veterans, and of
course our economy as a whole.

As Conservatives, we know what needs to be done to get our country back on track.

523,20170412,Mark Warawa,Budget review – Families and seniors left behind,"Dear Mike,

Budget 2017’s failure to deliver for seniors and the middle class is another broken
promise by the Trudeau Liberals.

Canada’s senior population exceeds the number of youth.

In just twelve short years, seniors will represent 25% of the Canadian population!

And what is Trudeau doing to address the issue of Canada’s aging population and
rapidly changing demographics? Not much:

No new senior-specific announcements in Budget 2017.  Eliminating the Family
Caregiver Tax Credit.  Trudeau has refused to appoint a Minister for Seniors to
advocate for their concerns around the cabinet table.

And it doesn’t get any better for the Canadian middle class.

To support their families, Canadians need a government that understands the economy.

But this budget produced no jobs plan.

All we got was higher taxes and more debt – $28.5 billion to be paid off by future
generations.

Our Conservative government was focused on supporting families.

That’s why we put in initiatives like the Universal Child Care Benefit, the
Children’s Fitness Tax Credit, the Children’s Art Tax Credit, tax credits for post-
secondary education and textbooks, and income splitting for families.

Unfortunately, the Liberals have eliminated these one by one - with the Public
Transit Tax Credit being the latest on their chopping block.

When we win again in 2019, putting the needs of ALL Canadians, young and old, will
once again become a priority for the government.

But we can’t do that without your  support

Flowery language, empty promises, deeper deficits, and no plan for the economy.

Looks like Budget 2017 produced a lot more of the same from the Trudeau Liberals.

After looking over the Budget document, a few things stood out:

No plan to help our farmers and fisherman.  No plan to help our energy sector.  No
plan to get infrastructure projects up and running.

In short: no plan to kick-start our economy!

Those who work in our agriculture and fisheries sectors now face higher insurance
premiums, eliminated tax deferrals, and no policies or program support.

Industry leaders in the energy sector are also concerned - waiting with bated breath
to see how Canada plans to keep up with the now surging U.S. economy.

As our counterparts to the south continue to lower taxes and cut red tape, the
Liberals are raising taxes, implementing Trudeau’s job killing carbon tax, and
removing incentives for small companies to make invest in new technologies.

>> Canadians deserve a government that works for them! <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

On infrastructure, Budget 2017 confirmed there will be no new spending on public
transit this year.

I suppose more infrastructure promises wouldn’t make much difference anyway, since
we’ve confirmed the Liberals have only started 6% of their announced infrastructure
projects since 2015.

As usual, the Liberals are more interested in photo ops and handshakes than getting
the job done.

We’re just weeks away from having a new permanent leader in place that will set the
course for Conservatives to bring an understanding of the economy back to the halls
of Parliament.

525,20170419,Ed Fast,Wow...,"Dear Mike,

By now I’m sure you have heard what Justin Trudeau wants you to hear about his
taxpayer subsidized vacation to the Bahamas.

Let’s re-cap what we know, shall we?

Trudeau’s story: It was just a “family vacation.”

Reality: Trudeau’s “family vacation” included MPs and their spouses, the Liberal
Party President, the President of Canada 2020, and staff members. Their destination?
The private island of a billionaire, whose foundation receives millions of dollars in
taxpayer funding.  A billionaire who also received tax dollars just for hosting the
Trudeau entourage.

Trudeau’s story: Taxpayers aren’t on the hook for costs.

Reality: The known costs to taxpayers so far have reached $133,000.  Up from the
$127,000 previously stated.

Trudeau’s story: He just had to fly aboard a billionaire’s private helicopter to get
to the billionaire’s private island because, in his own words, “travel to and from
the island only happens through private means.”

Reality: Trudeau lied. How do we know? Because the Liberals revealed thousands more
taxpayer dollars were spent flying a PCO “technician” (whatever that is) and some
equipment to the island - on a commercially chartered seaplane!

Justin Trudeau knew taking this vacation was bad optics.

He knew he was breaking the rules by accepting the private helicopter joy-ride.

That’s why he has tried so hard to keep things under wraps.

And it’s also why he is under investigation by the Conflict of Interest and Ethics
Commissioner!

The old Liberal entitlement is back in Ottawa. Hiking up your taxes and heaping debt
on future generations, all while Liberals live like rockstars on your dime.

Mike, I don’t need to tell you how important it is that we beat Justin Trudeau in
2019.

526,20170420,Conservative Party of Canada,Trudeau silent on border crossings,"Dear Mike,

No one can dispute Canada is a welcoming place.

As a nation, we’re known for doing our part to help those in need.

For decades we’ve opened our borders to those escaping religious persecution,
terrorism, and violent dictatorships.

However, since Justin Trudeau issued his open invitation on Twitter that “Canadians
will welcome you,” our country has seen an influx of asylum seekers illegally
crossing our border from a perfectly safe country – the United States.

And just last week we learned that “nearly half of the asylum seekers crossing the
Manitoba border illegally in the last few weeks are being detained because of serious
criminal records.”

One border services officer was allegedly assaulted by an asylum seeker that had been
detained for their criminal past!

>> Keep our Borders Safe! << [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

So far Justin Trudeau has been silent on the issue.

A recent opinion poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed 46% of those asked said they
“disagreed” with how Trudeau was handling the situation.

Fact: there are hundreds of thousands of people around the world who choose to come
to Canada using the proper, legal channels.

But with those illegally crossing from a safe, democratic country like the United
States, it appears Canada’s welcoming nature is being taken advantage of.

These illegal border crossings aren’t just unsafe for those seeking to come to Canada
- they also put a burden on local communities near the border.

It is during times like this that Canada needs strong, transparent leadership that
will enforce our laws and keep Canadians safe.

Help us set the course for victory in 2019.

Life as a Trudeau. Wealth, privilege, and power.

Last night Justin Trudeau revealed something that shows just how out of touch he is
with ordinary Canadians.

In an interview, Trudeau admitted his brother was once charged with drug possession
and their father used his connections to “make those charges go away.”

Once again, it’s a case of one set of rules for the Trudeau’s, and another for the
rest of Canada.

Trudeau claims to understand the middle class, but his actions tell another story.

$133,000 for a taxpayer-funded vacation to a billionaire’s private island in the

Jet-setting around the world to take glamourous photo shoots in Paris.

Leveraging his position as Prime Minister to solicit donations to the Trudeau

in.

On the day after the final official Conservative Party Leadership Debate, what better
time to say thank you for your support.

So far 2017 is off to a great start.  We’ve managed to sign up 150,000 brand new
members since January.

The best part? This brings our overall total to a record 259,010 members.

And let’s be clear, those are real memberships, representing real people.

Unlike other political parties, we didn’t just give these away to inflate our numbers
and chase headlines.

This is the result of hard, grassroots work connecting with Canadians and showing
them only the Conservative Party is the voice of taxpayers.

It is clear more and more Canadians are beginning to realize that Justin Trudeau just
has to go.

He can’t be trusted to keep his election promises. It has been a year and a half of
empty platitudes and poor policy decisions.

That’s what made last night’s final debate so significant.

All 13 Conservative Party Candidates who took the stage in Toronto may not agree on
everything, but it was clear they agree on one thing – that the Conservative Party is
the only party that can put Canada back on track.

With the nomination of our new leader just weeks away, we ask that you please

533,20170503,Kevin Sorenson,Looking back – moving forward,"Dear Mike,

A strong, stable, Conservative majority government!

It’s hard to believe six years have passed since those words came to fruition.

May 2nd 2011 was the culmination of years of hard work that led to the formation of
our long-sought Conservative majority.

>> Help us set the course for an election victory in 2019 <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

This month is going to be an exciting one.  We’re just weeks away from electing a new
permanent leader.

Then the hard work towards getting Canada back on track really begins!

Over the next 29 months we will continue fighting for lower taxes and responsible
government. We will continue to look out for everyday working people and their
families – something the Trudeau government has failed to do.

One thing our leadership contest has proven is that our party remains a vibrant
national organization with strong grassroots support from coast to coast to coast.

We need to keep building momentum.

Our new leader will set the course towards an election victory, but we won’t be able
to do it without the support of people like you!

Help us mark the anniversary of our majority victory in 2011 with a  donation

534,20170505,Stephen McCreary,Pay to play back again!,"Dear Mike,

After posting disastrous first quarter fundraising numbers, the Liberals are going
back to what they do best – selling government access to the highest bidder.

That’s right - the Liberals’ cash-for-access fundraising scheme is back.

Last year, the controversial plan helped the Liberals fill their war chest by
offering government access to those willing to pay for it.

This didn’t sit well with the Ethics Commissioner, who opened an investigation after:

The Finance Minister was caught red handed at a fundraiser organized by a company
executive that was also lobbying him.  A Communist Chinese billionaire donated a
large sum of cash to the Trudeau Foundation after a fundraiser with Trudeau – while
another attendee got the government favour he needed a short time after the meeting.
Liberal MP Bill Blair fundraised with associations looking to break into the
marijuana industry.

After months of pressure by our Conservative team, we forced the Liberals to finally
follow their own rules and halt the cash-for-access events.

… but then they saw their first quarter fundraising numbers.

This is what happens when the Liberals are forced to fundraise by the rules.

Now, according to the National Post, the Liberals are already set to resume their
cash-for-access ways.

They’re in full PR spin mode, trying to change the channel.

They’re attempting to change the rules so their previous improper fundraising tactics
can now appear within their rules.

They’ll say their fundraisers are open to the “public”, but the cost of admission
ranges from $250 to $1,500 a head – just like before.

The bottom line here?

The Liberals want to legislate away a public relations problem they themselves
created, when they can solve it simply by not selling government access to the
highest bidder.

Justin Trudeau and his Liberals clearly can’t be trusted to keep the promises they
make.

Our Conservative Party will continue to work hard on behalf of all Canadians – not
just those who can afford to buy government access.

Help us set the course to victory in 2019 with a donation today.

537,20170509,James Bezan,Caught in a lie - Again,"Dear Mike,

Trudeau’s Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan has a lot of explaining to do! And talking
points won’t cut it.

Sajjan has been caught making false claims - again.

The latest? That he was “the architect” behind the largest military operation in
Afghanistan.

He made the same claims during the 2015 election campaign.

One problem: it’s not true!

I agree with our interim leader, Rona Ambrose, who said in the House of Commons last
week:

“People in the military have a name for what he (Sajjan) did: it’s called ‘stolen
valour,’ when someone takes credit for the brave actions of another.”

And this isn’t the first time Sajjan has lied. He misled Canadians about the Iraqi
reaction to Canada withdrawing its CF18’s from combat against ISIS.

Sajjan claimed the Iraqis supported this move - but internal documents revealed the
Iraqis were actually very unhappy with the decision.

Our Armed Forces deserve better  [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

And now a fresh set of allegations - that Sajjan misled the Ethics Commissioner.

Cutting benefits to Canadian soldiers in Kuwait, taking credit for the work of our
brave men and women in uniform, and allegations of misleading the Ethics
Commissioner.

It’s clear that Sajjan can’t be trusted.

Since Trudeau refuses to remove him from cabinet, Sajjan must do the honourable thing
and step down as Canada's Defence Minister.

Support our efforts to bring honour and integrity back to government, and to our
Armed Forces. Please contribute today.

Sincerely,

James Bezan

541,20170517,Peter Van Loan,Trudeau’s huge mess,"Dear Mike,

Every day it becomes more evident the Trudeau Liberals are putting their own
interests before the interests of hard working Canadians.

First, the Trudeau Liberals spent $22,000 of your money on Snapchat filters.  They
assured Canadians that this waste of money was actually “key to helping Canada
achieve its foreign policy, trade, consular and development objectives.”

Seriously?! Saving the world one snap at a time, eh Justin?

Then we found out Trudeau and 600 of his closest friends decided to catch a Broadway
show – and you paid for it.

How much?  $30,000 just for the tickets to the show.  We’re still waiting for the
cost of flights, hotel stays, and other travel costs.

Worry not, though, Canadian taxpayers were reminded they need to be more tolerant and
understanding of such spending.

After all, catching this Broadway show was about ""protecting Canadian interests”,
according to Liberal MP Chrystia Freeland.

Protect Canadian taxpayer interests!
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

And while all this is happening, Trudeau still only wants to only show up for work
once a week – for the same pay.

Maybe that’s not such a bad idea, considering that even when he shows up, he doesn’t
do his job.

Last Wednesday, he was asked 18 times about his $130,000 taxpayer funded vacation to
the Bahamas that landed him in hot water with the Ethics Commissioner.

The answer?  We’re still waiting for one!

Trudeau refused, over and over again, to answer the simple question of how many times
he has met with the Ethics Commissioner.

Now Canadians are simply left to wonder for themselves.

During the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau said anything to win votes. He promised
“openness” and “transparency” But since then, he has delivered anything but, as these
most recent cases clearly show.

Help us change that. [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]] By supporting
us we can win the election in 2019 and once again put the interests of hard working
Canadians first.

Thanks to folks like you, our Conservative Party out fundraised the Liberals almost 2

So now the Liberals are going back to what they do best – selling government access
to the highest bidder.

>> Help us stop Cash for Access! << [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

The Liberals couldn’t follow their own rules, so now they say they’ve changed the
rules.

Yes, you read that right.

The Liberals are re-writing the rules because they couldn’t be trusted to follow the
original ones.

Unbelievable.

So now they’re back to their cash-for-access ways.

What’s the latest price for admission to rub elbows with the government decision
makers?

Well, if you’ve already forked over $1,500, it’ll just run you another 90 bucks.

Donate monthly?  Then Trudeau is all yours for a cool 500 dollars... on top of your
monthly donation.

But if you’re just looking for a one-time whisper in the ear of Trudeau, $750 will
get you in the door.

We in the Conservative Party understand that selling lobbyists access to government
officials is just wrong!

While the Liberals cater to millionaire executives and Chinese communist billionaires
looking for government favours, we continue to stand up for ordinary taxpayers like
you.

We can beat Justin Trudeau in 2019 and put an end to this type of thing – but we can
only do it with your help.

For months we’ve been warning you - now it’s almost here!

Residents of BC, Alberta, and Ontario are already feeling a little lighter in the
wallet.

Prices for transportation and heating fuels are about to go up coast to coast as
Justin Trudeau moves full steam ahead with his plan to intrude on provincial
jurisdiction by imposing a national Liberal carbon tax plan – even on provincially
owned utilities!

Once in place, estimates say Canadians can expect to pay as much as $2,600 per year
in new taxes.

The Globe and Mail reports this will add 11.6 cents per litre to the price of gas!
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

And now a secret briefing report shows the Liberals have been deliberately misleading
Canadians.

The report indicates that in order for the Liberals to reach their goals, they will
need to raise their carbon tax price by at least 600%!

Making matters worse, the Liberals have actually refused to release any comprehensive
accounting for the financial or economic impacts of Trudeau’s carbon tax.

It won’t be long before Trudeau’s carbon tax will be apparent on your hydro bill or
when you are paying at the pump.

We will keep fighting this, but we need people like you to stand alongside us.

550,20170531,Stephen McCreary,Let’s make Trudeau a one term PM!,"Dear Friend,

As our recent leadership race went on, the howls of outrage from the Liberals grew
louder.

For all the promises of real change and sunny ways, they sure sound like the same old
Liberals when it comes to spreading outright lies about Conservatives.

In an email last week, they made outrageous claims about the new Conservative Party
leader - no matter which of the 13 were elected.

The Liberals are more desperate than ever. They’re scared.

While the Liberals ironically try to scare people with depictions of tax-hiking
Conservatives (?!), let’s remember the first thing Trudeau did when he came to office
was eliminate our Family Tax Plan, which included the Universal Child Care Benefit,
our Children’s Fitness and Arts tax credits, and income splitting.  He then went on
to roll back the expanded limits to our Tax Free Savings Accounts.

For all the talking they do, and the baseless accusations they give to their spin
doctors to dish out, it’s actually the Liberals hurting the very people they claim to
help. Their policies hurt middle class families most, and it’s their high tax, high
debt ways that are “letting the middle class fall behind.”

In fact, under Conservative leadership, the median family after-tax earnings reached
an all-time high!  And the share of all income going to the top 1% has been falling
steadily since 2006, when Conservatives first formed government.

But the Liberals never let a few facts get in the way of a good lie!

My personal favourite is their scare-mongering about our plan for healthcare in
Canada.

What they never tell people though, is that Conservatives increased healthcare
transfers - by 70%!

Yes, facts take a backseat when the Liberals are on stage.

So many outlandish claims about us, when Canadians have so many questions about them!

Like explaining how, exactly, a massive carbon tax that will cost each family $2,600
per year (and drive the cost of gas up 11 cents per litre) will “help the middle
class.”

And they never explain how forty years of completely unnecessary multi-billion dollar
deficits are going to help the next generation of “middle class” Canadians.

Nor have they justified how various payroll increases will help Canadians pay their
bills.

The Liberals think if they spread enough lies about Conservatives - and dress up
their bad policies with enough cutesy graphics and selfies of Trudeau - Canadians
will forgive their many failings.

But their terrible policies present serious issues. And Trudeau needs to be held
accountable.

Like our new leader Andrew Scheer said:

“I can’t let Justin Trudeau do to my five children, what his father did to my
generation.”

I couldn’t agree more.

That’s why today, I am re-activating our  One-Term Trudeau Fund
[https://donate.conservative.ca/one-term-trudeau?mpi=[campaignid]].

We owe it to the next generation of Canadians to leave Canada in better shape than we
inherited it.

So help me  fill our One-Term Trudeau Fund today [https://donate.conservative.ca/one-
term-trudeau?mpi=[campaignid]].

Every penny we raise will go directly to countering these Liberal lies, and ensuring
we are in the best position possible to win the next election.

Working together, we can get Canada back on track in 2019.

553,20170607,Andrew Scheer,Trudeau’s carbon tax has to go!,"Dear Mike,

During my leadership campaign, I received tremendous support on many issues important
to Canadian families.

One issue stood out above the rest, though - the Liberal carbon tax is nothing more
than a cash grab!

Once elected Prime Minister, I will repeal it.

And I’ll go even further by scrapping the GST/HST from home heating and electricity
bills - because only a Liberal would think that in Canada, heating your home in the
winter is a luxury.

Justin Trudeau's 'Ottawa Knows Best' plan of imposing a massive carbon tax is a cold-
hearted attack on Canadian families and their monthly budgets.

Trudeau’s policies are hurting the very people he claims to help, and that’s a
charade that needs to stop now.

>>  Help us stop Trudeau’s carbon tax!  <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

Mike, I have also made a promise to balance the budget in my first two years in
power.

We need to get our fiscal house in order and as Conservatives, you and I both know
that we are the only ones capable of doing that.

It is so important we get the economy back on the right track and get our country
heading in the right direction.

And scrapping Trudeau’s carbon tax - a tax that will cost the average Canadian family
$2,600 more per year and will put our economy at risk in a competitive global
marketplace - is a major step in that direction.

Join me, and my fellow Conservatives, as we set the course towards a Conservative
victory in 2019.

Sincerely,

Andrew Scheer

555,20170613,Dustin van Vugt,Our One Term Trudeau Fund!,"Dear Mike,

Canadian business magnate, investor, and philanthropist Stephen Jarislowski recently
said:

“You do not build a prosperous nation by excessively taxing those who create
prosperity and jobs.”

Unfortunately, Justin Trudeau didn’t get the message.

He should spend less time trying to get on U.S. talk shows and more time focusing on
how he’s going to get us out of the fiscal mess he created.

As Conservatives, we understand the value of a balanced budget.

That’s why we balanced the federal budget in 2015.

But with Trudeau in charge, deficits have become the norm.  So much for his promised
“modest” $10 billion deficits - now we’re looking at trillions of dollars of debt,
and no balanced budget until 2055.

How is Trudeau paying for his out of control spending?  Higher taxes of course!

And the problem with that runs deeper than the immediate pain in your pocketbook.

With higher taxes comes the risk that Canada’s best and brightest entrepreneurs,
companies, and corporations will look to greener pastures - where the tax burden
isn’t so onerous.

Case in point – Trudeau’s carbon tax.

Both Ontario and Alberta have already adopted carbon tax policies. And both provinces
are seeing first-hand the negative impacts on their economies because of it.

Trudeau’s many mistakes aren’t just hurting our economy now – they’re putting the
long-term health of our economy at risk, and burdening the next generation of
Canadians with our debt.

We must ensure that Justin Trudeau’s damage is limited to one term only.

Please help us fill our One-Term Trudeau fund today. [https://donate.conservative.ca

556,20170614,Andrew Scheer,Protect free speech,"Dear Mike,

They police speech. They are shutting down events. They attack professors and guest
speakers.

All across North America, free speech is under attack.

And sadly, it is under attack at the one place it should be most celebrated:
universities.

Far from bastions of free speech and new ideas, universities are now often where free
speech goes to die, as events are regularly shut down by perpetually offended
protesters.

This is wrong.

During my campaign I spoke about the need for Canadian universities to foster free
flowing dialogue and debate.

Once elected, I will withhold federal grants from universities that won’t respect a
diversity of viewpoints.

We believe universities should be a place for education – a place where young adults
can learn to think for themselves by being presented with alternative opinions and
ideas.

We don’t believe it should be a place that allows healthy debate to be shut down
because it’s a topic someone, somewhere might disagree with.

Free speech matters and should be allowed everywhere – including on university
campuses!

If you agree, donate now – help us prepare to defeat Justin Trudeau in 2019.

I’m proud to be a Conservative.  I’m proud to represent my constituents as their MP,
and I’m proud to stand fully behind Andrew Scheer, our party’s newest leader.

I am confident that under his leadership our party will remain strong and united as
we continue to be the voice of all Canadians.

Despite what our political opponents want you to believe, the Conservatives are the
only party truly committed to the best interests of Canadians – unlike the Liberals.

We are a big tent party, and with Andrew Scheer at the helm, we’ll continue to grow
our movement!  Whether its fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, supporters in
the west, on the prairies, in urban centres, Quebec, the Maritimes, or the North,
there is a place for everyone in the Conservative Party of Canada.

We don’t have to look very far back to know what happens when we’re not strong and
united, and not focused on defending Canadian taxpayers. We get successive Liberal
governments that mishandle and mismanage our economy and only look to serve
themselves.

But when we are strong and united? We won back-to-back-to-back elections – giving
Canadians a strong, stable, majority Conservative government, focused on tax cuts and
job creation.

And we will do it again!

Support a strong, united Conservative Party

To all the candidates that put their names on the ballot in our leadership campaign,
and the members and supporters like you that stuck with us throughout – thank you.

I know you’ve heard platitudes about blood, sweat, and tears.  But what it really
takes to run a successful political party is grassroots support, strong funding, and
an understanding of what policies connect with Canadians.

That’s why I am so excited for the future of our party.  With strong leadership,
exciting policy ideas, and almost 100 caucus colleagues willing to work together with
one goal in mind – to defeat the Trudeau Liberals in 2019 – we will be unstoppable!

Stand with me, join Team Scheer and help us prepare for the 2019 election TODAY.

558,20170616,Peter Kent,Selling out our national security!,"Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau is putting the interests of his friends, closely connected with
Beijing, ahead of the safety and security of Canadians.

Back in 2015, our Conservative government blocked the sale of a Canadian electronics
firm to China’s O-Net Communications - due to national security concerns.

But the Liberals reversed our decision.

And now, the Liberals are set to approve another Chinese takeover deal of a
Vancouver-based company that builds satellite receivers for NATO – while refusing to
subject this takeover to a full national security review.

Canada uses this company's technology for its own military purposes. Without a proper
national security review, Canada’s safety and security -- and that of our allies --
are being put at risk.

Even the former head of CSIS said he would have recommended a full national security
review of this deal.

As I've said before, China’s drive to militarize the South China Sea and the
technological ramifications of a deal like this, deserve much more due diligence.

So why is the Prime Minister so fascinated with China and their “basic dictatorship”?

Why does he have such an overwhelming desire to appease his friends in Beijing – so
much so, that it clouds his judgment on Canada's national security?

Is this the Prime Minister's way of thanking his Chinese communist government
billionaire friends who paid top dollar to meet with him privately a year ago?

This is a worrying trend – one where Trudeau is putting his own interests ahead of
the best interests of our country.

Canadian security – not Chinese government connected donors to the Liberal Party –
needs to be top of mind for Justin Trudeau.

Donate now if you agree. [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

560,20170621,Peter Van Loan,The Liberals call it a levy– we call it what it is…,"Dear Mike,

The Liberals would prefer you call it a “levy” on “broadband internet providers.”

But Canadians know what it really is: an internet tax!

Last week, Liberal MPs on the Liberal dominated Heritage Committee recommended a new
5% internet tax on streaming services like Netflix and iTunes.

In the last election, Justin Trudeau was adamant they’d never tax streaming services,
but can he be taken at his word?

He promised “modest” $10 billion deficits – not true!  He promised 2015 would be the
last election under the first past the post model – not going to happen!  He promised
the Liberals would be more open and accountable – ...not yet!  He said the only way
to get to his private Bahama island oasis for a holiday was on his friends’ private
helicopter – that was a lie.

Trudeau knows taxing internet consumers will allow the Liberals to generate “hundreds
of millions of dollars in revenues.”

Canadians already pay some of the highest internet rates in the world - but that
isn’t stopping the Liberals from wanting to take more money out of your pocket.

A new tax on beer and wine, cancelled public transit tax credits, a new tax on Uber…
and now the Liberals want you to pay more to use the internet.

Help us stop the Trudeau Liberals from nickel and diming Canadians to death!

A  donation [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=50] from you today

562,20170623,James Bezan,On defense spending – the Liberals can’t be trusted,"Dear Mike,

The Liberal government has released its long-awaited defence policy. As usual, it’s
full of Liberal platitudes and big promises.

And that’s why Conservatives are so concerned.

Based on the Liberals’ dismal record on delivering anything they promised during the
2015 election - is it any wonder we are skeptical now?

On the defence file specifically, here’s the Liberals record since 2015:

Cuts to the Department of National Defence budget  Made a mess of important
procurement projects including replacing our fighter jets and navy vessels  Ended
Canada’s air mission against ISIS  Hid the fact they withdrew an RCAF surveillance
aircraft from its Iraq mission  Eliminated tax breaks for troops fighting ISIS in the
middle east, until our efforts forced them to reverse their decision

And let’s not forget the Minister of National Defence has repeatedly misled
Canadians.

No matter what they would have you believe, the Liberals have no credibility when it
comes to national defence.

Conservatives have always believed our men and women in uniform deserve the best
equipment, training and support available today – not sometime in the distant future!

The Liberals, on the other hand, plan on holding our military hostage by promising
additional funding – however that funding will not be made available until AFTER the
next election.

Every time the Liberals have been given an opportunity to step up, they stepped back.

They have stood on the sidelines watching our allies do the heavy lifting and the
Liberals expect our troops to do more with less.

Actions speak louder than words. That’s why I am asking for your help.

A donation today will go a long way to making sure we can  do right by our brave men
and women in uniform. [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]]

566,20170630,Stephen McCreary,Justin Trudeau...,"Dear Mike,

Let me say it bluntly: with Justin Trudeau leading this country, we’re all worse off.

It’s that simple.

We talk a lot about what Trudeau hasn’t done: he didn’t keep his low deficit promise;
he broke his electoral reform promise; he went back on his promise to be open and
transparent; and he reneged on his promise to lower the small business tax rate.

But to understand how bad it really is, it is important to look at what Justin
Trudeau has done:

He has given Canadian citizenship back to convicted terrorists.  He has focused his
time on admiring basic dictatorships like China, fondly recalling ruthless dictators
like Fidel Castro, and even cozying up with communist government-connected
billionaires.  He has been selling access to government to anyone that donates enough
money to the Liberal Party,  He has been stacking the Senate with people involved in
the Trudeau Foundation.  He has completely eliminated Conservative tax cuts and tax
breaks that benefitted hard-working Canadian families.  He has raised taxes on
everything from alcohol to Uber to bus passes, and will soon be forcing a massive
carbon tax onto the entire country which will drive up the cost of everything.  He
has nickel and dimed Canadians so much, we’re now projected to have forty years of
deficits which will pile $1.5 trillion of debt onto our children, and their children.

At worst, these policies go against the very fabric of Canadian society.

At best, these policies are making life more expensive and hurting the “middle class”
that Trudeau is always claiming to help.

Here is the good news: we can stop this.

There is a better path. One that focuses on people like you: hard-working, everyday
Canadians that make sacrifices to secure a better future for their children.

That’s why we have re-activated our   One-Term Trudeau Fund.

Every penny we raise will go directly towards bringing this message to more

Christopher Speer with a grenade.

The same Omar Khadr who’s on video building improvised explosive devices exactly like

The Liberal  Cash for Access [http://cash4access.ca/] scheme is alive and well.

Media reports say guests at one of Trudeau’s recent fundraisers included “a supporter
who subsequently received a federal appointment and another man who bought a ticket
for the sole purpose of speaking to Trudeau about legislation currently in
Parliament.”

A donation for a plum government appointment. A donation in exchange for the
opportunity to lobby the Prime Minister. The Liberals are selling access to

And it’s blatantly against their rules.

That’s right – the Liberals can’t even follow the rules they put in place for

We understand political parties have to fundraise – but there is fundamental
difference between us and the Liberals.

This isn’t an accusation – it’s a fact backed up by the Canada Border Services

chains into Canada as a result of lifting this visa.

They now report that in 2017 the number of Mexicans associated with ""serious"" crimes‎
has already surpassed the total from last year, as well as in 2015.

More worrisome? The number of individuals identified for ""national security"" concerns
is higher than the past two years combined!

These criminals‎ have been identified as smugglers of narcotics, human smugglers,
launderers and other thugs associated with the criminal underworld.

572,20170712,Andrew Scheer,Omar Khadr,"Dear Mike,

Over the past week, the response to the news about Omar Khadr has been swift and
vocal.

Canadians are shocked by Justin Trudeau’s decision to give a $10.5 million secret
payout to the terrorist who killed US Army Sergeant Christopher Speer in Afghanistan.

Make no mistake. This settlement is a choice made by Justin Trudeau.

And it is a slap in the face to the men and women in uniform who face incredible
danger every day to keep us safe.

It is one thing to acknowledge alleged mistreatment.

But the Liberals rushed to make this payment, and tried to hide and then downplay it.

Showing such contempt to a widow of a war hero who lost his life saving the lives of
others on the battlefield is not just wrong, it’s disgusting.

Justin Trudeau has had multiple opportunities to explain his choice in this matter,
but he has chosen not to. When asked about this matter repeatedly, Justin Trudeau
dodged any accountability to Canadians.

Sergeant Speer’s family has struggled with the loss of their husband and father since
his death at Khadr’s hands in 2002.

I cannot imagine what they have endured in these past fifteen years, and my thoughts
have been with them since this news first broke.

If Omar Khadr is truly sorry for what he has done, that money should be given
directly to the family of Sergeant Speer.

Justin Trudeau should have never agreed to a secret deal that gave a convicted
terrorist millions of dollars.

Let’s be clear about one crucial point: the remedy to the issues that the Supreme
Court ruled upon was the repatriation of Khadr back to Canada.

That was the settlement that Khadr received.

Seeking money from the Canadian taxpayer is just a sign of continuing contempt for
the country that Khadr has fought against.

As Prime Minister, I would have fought against this payout in court and made
absolutely clear -- taxpayers won’t be rewarding an admitted terrorist.

Now it’s up to Justin Trudeau to explain his decision to Canadians.

Sincerely,

Andrew Scheer

The Liberals have ignored the needs of our border security. And now, according to the
national president of the Customs and Immigration Union, the number of illegal border
crossings have increased significantly – to “crisis” levels.

Justin Trudeau needs to act. He needs to enforce our laws.

The number of people trying to illegally enter Canada has increased dramatically, and
we’ve seen no action from the Trudeau Liberals.

One can only imagine what the latest numbers will show as the Liberals continue to
try to sweep this issue under the rug and ignore it.

This week, my colleagues have shared with you recent examples of how the Trudeau
Liberals continue to ignore problems of their own creation – cash-for-government
access fundraising, increased taxes, higher debt, and now problems with our border
security.

So, when half of the illegal immigrants crossing into places like Manitoba are being
detained “because of serious criminal records,” why isn’t Justin Trudeau making an
effort to stop it?

As former Public Safety Minister, it is becoming more and more clear just how
important it is to hold Justin Trudeau’s damage to Canada to one term only.

What’s up with the Trudeau Liberals spending your money on their pet projects?

The more cash they spend on their own priorities means less money in your pocket.

First it was huge moving expenses. Then it was Caribbean vacations.

And now the Trudeau Liberals are giving away more than 240 million – yes almost a
quarter of a billion dollars to nearly 20 organizations outside of Canada – including
$20 million for the Clinton Foundation.

Liberal MPs weren’t any better:

Liberal MP Mark Holland blew almost $500 for a bouncy castle, when he could have
rented it for about half the price.  MP Sonia Sidhu managed to spend almost seven and
a half thousand dollars on a BBQ.  And of course our PM, ever the party goer, blew
over $500 of your tax dollars on booze for a “constituency event.”

Justin Trudeau is throwing around money like there’s no tomorrow – and you’re paying
for it with higher taxes and the elimination of major Conservative tax breaks.

Under Trudeau, you’re paying more for your kids to play sports, and you can’t take
advantage of income splitting.  Commuters can no longer claim a rebate on their
transit pass – and we will all pay more for everything thanks to Trudeau’s carbon
tax.

So the next time you hear Liberals justifying their big tax hikes, remember what
they’re spending your money on.

578,20170719,Conservative Party of Canada,Omar Khadr,"Dear Mike,

It has now been two weeks since Canadians found out Justin Trudeau was about to hand
$10.5 million of taxpayer money to convicted terrorist Omar Khadr.

The money has now changed hands, and Justin Trudeau has dodged accountability at
every opportunity.

Canadians have very real, very legitimate questions in regards to how the Liberal
government paid $10.5 million to someone who built the same bombs responsible for
killing our Canadian soldiers.

71% of Canadians have problems with this payout, and questions about the process.

And we can’t blame them.

The government handed millions of taxpayer dollars to someone that fought against
Canadian troops, and murdered a US Army medic, leaving children without a father, and
a wife without a husband.

The Liberals wanted to hide the payout to avoid the tough questions they knew
Canadians would have. In fact, we only found out about the $10 million payday because
someone leaked it to the media!

You can be sure over the coming weeks and months, this issue will stay alive. We will
keep asking the questions Canadians have.

This isn’t just a slap in the face to Canadian taxpayers, but more importantly, also
to our men and women in uniform.

We’ve always stood up for taxpayers. We’ve never shied away from holding the Liberals
to account for their decisions.

We will never stop asking the questions that Canadians want answered, no matter how
much Justin Trudeau and the Liberals try to avoid it.

MAJOR UPDATE!!

We have new information on the six month long investigation into Justin Trudeau’s
potentially unethical trip to the Bahamas.

In a bid to hide as much information as possible, the government heavily redacted the

government.

It turns out officials worked on the assumption that the trip really was an “official
visit”, despite Trudeau’s claim that it was a “family holiday”.

This likely made the trip much more expensive than it needed to be.

“Trudeau is in jeopardy of becoming the first sitting prime minister to have been

I know, I know. Old news.

But it’s important.

$30 billion annual deficits, no plan for a balanced budget for the next three
decades, and a trajectory towards $1.5 trillion in overall debt.

Trudeau is passing along his huge credit card bills to our children.

Ottawa, ON K1P 5G4
    "
585,20170728,Andrew Scheer,Justin Trudeau had a choice on Khadr settlement,"Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau seems to have found a new defence for his choice to make a convicted
terrorist a wealthy man.

After first blaming the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, then the Supreme Court, then
the previous government, Trudeau is now saying the Government of Canada could pay
now, or it could pay later. Omar Khadr, according to the Liberals, was going to get
his millions either way.

The Liberals are deliberately saying things that are not true to hide the fact that
this payout was 100% their choice. But the majority of Canadians simply aren’t buying
it.

The Supreme Court of Canada never ordered a multimillion dollar payout to Omar Khadr,
and in fact never dictated any monetary compensation at all.

The Supreme Court ruled that in very narrow circumstances, Omar Khadr’s rights were
violated. Conservatives accept that finding. We accept the extremely important
principle that the Charter applies to all Canadians, no matter how heinous the crime.

The inconvenient truth for the Liberals, is that the court left it to the government
of the day to determine the appropriate compensation for these violations. A lower-
court ruling had indicated that the appropriate remedy for Omar Khadr would be
repatriation. In other words, the wrong could be righted by allowing Khadr to serve
out the rest of his sentence in Canada.

The previous Conservative government accepted the court finding. Omar Khadr was
brought back to Canada and able to enjoy the benefits of the Canadian justice system
— the same justice system that has been generous enough to give him his freedom
today, while his victims remain dead, wounded, or grieving. That is all the
compensation he deserves. Anything above that is a secondary compensation that goes
over and above what any court has ordered.

Yet Justin Trudeau felt it appropriate to turn Khadr into a millionaire, even rushing
payment to him as quickly and quietly as possible.

By handing payment to Omar Khadr in secret, Justin Trudeau would surely have
understood that Tabitha Speer and her children — the family of Omar Khadr’s victim,
Sgt. Christopher Speer — could be denied any access to the compensation.

Justin Trudeau could have taken a stand and fought the Khadr case until the very end.
Last week, in his latest desperate attempt at deflecting blame, Trudeau has asked us
to believe that he was so worried about spending taxpayers’ money, that he
surrendered the legal fight.

For the man who is plunging Canada into massive deficits and borrowing more and more
money from future generations of Canadians, this last excuse is almost laughable.
Besides, principles are worth fighting for.

Conservatives believe in supporting the women and men in uniform who put their lives
on the line to keep us safe, not those who target them.

So I understand the vast majority of Canadians who are upset by the prime minister’s
decision. I am too. A government I lead would be guided by a set of principles that
would have ensured we fought this case to the end.

For Justin Trudeau to suggest this was OK — indeed, to go even further by attempting
to dodge any responsibility once he got caught — is not what we need in a prime
minister.

Justin Trudeau had a choice. He could have fought this in court. No court decision is
ever a given, no matter how many Liberals pretend otherwise.

And when the House of Commons returns in the fall, our Conservative caucus’s first
task will be to hold Justin Trudeau accountable for his choice.

He cannot hide from it. That isn’t to say he hasn’t tried.

Trudeau was absent for the Liberal government’s apology to Omar Khadr. He was absent
for the announcement of the payout. He has let others in his government do the dirty
work, and made himself invisible in the meantime.

Most shockingly, after being forced to explain his decision, Trudeau claimed he
speaks for all Canadians when it comes to his secret Khadr payout.

It is typical Liberal arrogance for Trudeau to claim he represents what Canadians
think and feel about this issue. He represents the government of Canada, not the core
beliefs of its people.

So my question to you is simple.

Do you agree with Trudeau’s secret payout to Omar Khadr? Does Trudeau speak for you?

When Justin Trudeau got elected, he made a lot of big promises, and a lot of big talk

Doing things differently in Liberal-speak apparently means ignoring your promises

Broken promise on electoral reform? Check.

Spending money on Liberal pet projects with little to no value to Canadians? Check.

Multiple investigations by various government watchdogs centered on Trudeau’s

Commissioner was forced to step aside, Trudeau ""will not recuse himself from the
hiring process for the next lobbying commissioner, even though the current one is
investigating two fundraisers that wealthy lobbyists held for the prime minister.""

How can a Prime Minister be trusted to choose a non-partisan political watchdog for
an office currently conducting two investigations – and possibly more – into his own

As we hit the mid-way point of summer, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer continues
travelling the country – meeting Canadians at BBQs, pizza parties, churches, legions,
and coffee shops.

Andrew is busy sharing his vision for our great country.

And what are the Liberals up to?

Well, after a brief hiatus due to the public outrage, the Trudeau Liberals are once
again busy with their cash-for-access fundraising strategy.

Yes, that’s right - despite multiple ongoing investigations into his shady
fundraisers, Justin Trudeau is once again making himself available to the highest
bidder.

Let’s show them that strong grassroots support will win the day.

590,20170804,Conservative Party of Canada,Great news!!,"Dear Mike,

The numbers are in for the second quarter - and our Conservative Party led the way.

We out fundraised the Liberals by more than a million dollars. We did this by taking
in more than 32,400 contributions for a sum total of:

$4,073,665

Here is what 2017 looks like so far:

And this does not include the $6.5 million raised this year by the candidates running
in our leadership race.

Our new leader Andrew Scheer is clearly connecting with Canadians!

While this is great news - it comes with a bit of caution!

During the first quarter of 2017, we out fundraised the Liberals nearly two to one.

In response, they have gone back to doing what they do best – raising money by
holding their unethical cash-for-access events.

They are closing the fundraising gap as a result!

The next election is just around the corner. We are the only ones capable of
defeating the Trudeau Liberals and bringing common sense back to Ottawa in 2019.

But we can’t do it without the continued support of people like you!

Help us keep the momentum going with a $38 donation today!

597,20170816,Conservative Party of Canada,Trudeau’s choice on Omar Khadr,"Dear Mike,

In a recent op-ed, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer posed the following questions:

Do you agree with Justin Trudeau’s secret payout to Omar Khadr?

Does Trudeau speak for you?

Justin Trudeau chose to make Omar Khadr one of Canada’s wealthiest men.

Trudeau blamed the Charter, the Supreme Court, and the previous government for his
decision.

But none of those are to blame.

Neither is the excuse that Khadr was going to get paid one way or another and Trudeau
just wanted to save taxpayer dollars.

There has never been a Supreme Court order to provide any financial compensation to
Khadr.

In fact, a court ruling indicated it would be left for “the government to decide how
best to respond”.

So, in our view, Khadr serving the remainder of his jail sentence for murdering a
U.S. medic Christopher Speer, in Canada was all Khadr deserved.

Now – he’s a free man.

Thanks to Justin Trudeau’s taxpayer funded handout, he’s also a multi-millionaire.

Meanwhile, Christopher Speer’s wife and children live every day without a husband or
a father.

Does that seem right to you?

We believe principles are worth fighting for – it seems Justin Trudeau does not.

At least 71% of Canadians agree the Omar Khadr payout was wrong.

We’re going to keep standing up for them.

In a bid to syphon more tax dollars from the working public, Justin Trudeau’s latest
tweaks to the tax system are set to target “The majority of Canada’s physicians.”

Canada’s healthcare system is under fire. Quality patient care is at risk!

Last month, the Trudeau Liberals proposed new changes to the tax code that target the
ability of doctors to re-invest in their practices, and make it harder to attract
physicians to our country.

Trudeau’s poor decision will affect the lives of everyday Canadians, potentially
increasing wait times in the ER and for elective surgeries, while making it harder to
get a family physician.

The President of the Ontario Medical Association has made his feelings quite clear,
stating “this is a bad idea for a significant number of people across Canada”, and
warning “there’s no way this won’t affect patient care.”

601,20170823,Andrew Scheer,Trudeau broke the system,"Dear Mike,

Canada's Conservatives want an immigration system that is compassionate and
efficient. One that works to protect the world's most vulnerable.

What Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has allowed to happen is putting a huge
strain on immigration resources.

It is also shortchanging those who are trying to enter our country legally.

It isn't fair to those Canadians who waited years to come to our great country
through the proper channels.

What's even more irresponsible is that Justin Trudeau knows that most of those
crossing illegally will not be allowed to stay when processed by our system. Most of
their claims will be denied.

The main reason is because they are not fleeing persecution or violence. We have an
agreement with the United States called the Safe Third Country Agreement, which
recognizes that when people make an asylum claim in America, they have reached
safety. They are no longer fleeing persecution.

I have been to upstate New York and I've been to North Dakota. Those places are very
safe.

But the Liberals are doing nothing to stop the flow.

In fact, they're setting up refugee camps along the border.

The Liberal approach is irresponsible, and sadly gives false hope to thousands of
people who are now risking their lives.

Tragically, we have even had a death at the border.

Thousands of people waiting in refugee camps in the Middle East and Africa - who are
facing real persecution - will now have to wait even longer.

That's not compassionate.

For months, Conservatives have been demanding the government to come up with a plan
to stop these illegal crossings.

Canadians haven't heard one.

The Trudeau Liberals have broken Canada's immigration system. Canadians, and those
looking to join our family the right way, deserve much better.

Trudeau has asked Canadians to trust our immigration system. The problem is, we don't
trust Liberals to manage it.

603,20170824,Lisa Raitt,What do the Liberals have against small businesses?,"Dear Mike,

“A large percentage of small businesses are actually just ways for wealthier
Canadians to save on their taxes.”

Some of you may have forgotten, but those were the words of Justin Trudeau during the
2015 election campaign.

This did not sit well with local business owners.

Trudeau tried to smooth things over by promising to “reduce the small business tax
rate to 9% from 11%.”

There’s one problem though: the Liberals broke that promise.

Instead, now they want to raise taxes on those local business owners!

The Liberals’ tax grab on local businesses is facing criticism from every corner.

“This is just one more way to discourage entrepreneurship, on top of all the tax
increases in the past two years.”

- Jack M. Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of Calgary’s School of Public
Policy

""If implemented, these proposals would create uncertainty for physicians and make it
difficult for doctors to plan for their clinics, staff and equipment, and ultimately,
provide dedicated services to their patients.""

- Dr. Shawn Watley, President of the Ontario Medical Association

“What the government will do here is stifle entrepreneurs who have been the backbone
of Canada's growth.”

- Kim Moody, director of Canadian tax advisory at Moodys Gartner Tax Law in Calgary

Local business owners are the backbone of our economy.  They create jobs and provide
much needed services.

Canada’s Conservatives believe they should be treated with respect.

We should be looking at ways to provide them with the tools to succeed and make them
more competitive!

Ottawa, ON K1P 5G4
    "
604,20170825,Andrew Scheer,Conservatives have a positive vision,"Dear Mike,

Even if you’ve never voted Conservative before, you probably know that Conservatives
support lowering taxes as a way to help Canadians and our economy.

But maybe you don’t know “why” we support lower taxes.

We believe there is more to Canada than just government, and this belief is at the
core of the positive Conservative vision we’ve been sharing with Canadians all
summer.

We believe taxes should be lower for Canadians: for businesses, families and
individuals. This is the core of a Conservative vision to create prosperity and
opportunity for everyone.

Our support for lower taxes isn’t a matter of seeing black ink on a ledger, or
because we want to get a favourable press release from a Chamber of Commerce.

We believe in lowering taxes because it is good for Canadian families.

When we keep payroll taxes low, it helps the young worker looking to get their first
job.

But when the government raises payroll taxes, like the Liberals have done, it makes
it harder for young people to start their careers.

When we keep taxes on Canadian small businesses low, it helps those companies invest,
expand, and hire more workers.

But when you cancel tax cuts on small businesses, as the Liberals did in their first
budget, it comes at the expense of those looking for work.

And when we cut taxes for families, it means they have a little more money in their
pocket at the end of every month.

It means a single mom will be able to send her kids to summer camp, or a family can
save for their child’s education.

This is more important than ever.

Recent data from the 2016 Census revealed that more Canadians than ever before are
living alone. That means fewer households have a dual income to rely on. And it’s
getting harder for kids to move out of their parents’ house. We see this in practice
every day, in communities across the country.

Helping Canadians save more of their own money is critical if we want to ensure a
better future for all.

Yet, with federal spending at an all-time high, the Trudeau Liberal government is
looking to pass the bill to someone else.

And that means tax and user fee hikes for the everyday Canadian taxpayer. And it’s
not just on the obvious expenses – their approach amounts to a tax on everyday life.

Increased user fees for campsites, fishing licenses and passports are one part of
their plan. Continuously increasing taxes on beer and wine is another. By 2022,
Trudeau’s carbon tax will increase the price of gasoline by 11 cents per litre,
making any family road trip a lot more expensive.

On top of all of it are year-round tax hikes on public transit, ridesharing services
like Uber, and kids’ sports and arts activities.

Justin Trudeau claims the best of intentions, but his policies hurt the very people
he says they want to help.

They came to office saying they wanted to help families, but they’re now treating
summertime family activities as a source of tax revenue to cover their spending
problem.

Lower taxes mean the government has faith in the everyday men and women of Canada to
make the best decisions for themselves and their families. This is how we create
prosperity and opportunity for everyone in Canada, no matter who you are.

This is what Conservatives believe in.

And these everyday families are who Canada’s Conservatives are here to fight for.

If you want to help us with that fight please consider a  donation today

606,20170827,Lisa Raitt,More Liberal tax hikes.,"Dear Mike,

“A large percentage of small businesses are actually just ways for wealthier
Canadians to save on their taxes.”

Some of you may have forgotten, but those were the words of Justin Trudeau during the
2015 election campaign.

This did not sit well with local business owners.

Trudeau tried to smooth things over by promising to “reduce the small business tax
rate to 9% from 11%.”

There’s one problem though: the Liberals broke that promise.

Instead, now they want to raise taxes on those local business owners!

The Liberals’ tax grab on local businesses is facing criticism from every corner.

“This is just one more way to discourage entrepreneurship, on top of all the tax
increases in the past two years.”

- Jack M. Mintz, President’s Fellow at the University of Calgary’s School of Public
Policy

""If implemented, these proposals would create uncertainty for physicians and make it
difficult for doctors to plan for their clinics, staff and equipment, and ultimately,
provide dedicated services to their patients.""

- Dr. Shawn Watley, President of the Ontario Medical Association

“What the government will do here is stifle entrepreneurs who have been the backbone
of Canada's growth.”

- Kim Moody, director of Canadian tax advisory at Moodys Gartner Tax Law in Calgary

Local business owners are the backbone of our economy.  They create jobs and provide
much needed services.

Canada’s Conservatives believe they should be treated with respect.

We should be looking at ways to provide them with the tools to succeed and make them
more competitive!

Your  donation of $38 today [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]
will help stand up for local business owners, defeat Trudeau in 2019, and restore
fiscal responsibility to Ottawa.

Thank you for your support.

Ottawa, ON K1P 5G4
    "
607,20170827,Andrew Scheer,A positive vision.,"Good morning Mike,

Even if you’ve never voted Conservative before, you probably know that Conservatives
support lowering taxes [https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38] as a
way to help Canadians and our economy.

But maybe you don’t know “why” we support lower taxes.

We believe there is more to Canada than just government, and this belief is at the
core of the positive Conservative vision we’ve been sharing with Canadians all
summer.

We believe taxes should be lower for Canadians: for businesses, families and
individuals. This is the core of a Conservative vision to create prosperity and
opportunity for everyone.

Our support for lower taxes isn’t a matter of seeing black ink on a ledger, or
because we want to get a favourable press release from a Chamber of Commerce.

We believe in lowering taxes because it is good for Canadian families.

When we keep payroll taxes low, it helps the young worker looking to get their first
job.

But when the government raises payroll taxes, like the Liberals have done, it makes
it harder for young people to start their careers.

When we keep taxes on Canadian small businesses low, it helps those companies invest,
expand, and hire more workers.

But when you cancel tax cuts on small businesses, as the Liberals did in their first
budget, it comes at the expense of those looking for work.

And when we cut taxes for families, it means they have a little more money in their
pocket at the end of every month.

It means a single mom will be able to send her kids to summer camp, or a family can
save for their child’s education.

This is more important than ever.

Recent data from the 2016 Census revealed that more Canadians than ever before are
living alone. That means fewer households have a dual income to rely on. And it’s
getting harder for kids to move out of their parents’ house. We see this in practice
every day, in communities across the country.

Helping Canadians save more of their own money is critical if we want to ensure a
better future for all.

Yet, with federal spending at an all-time high, the Trudeau Liberal government is
looking to pass the bill to someone else.

And that means tax and user fee hikes for the everyday Canadian taxpayer. And it’s
not just on the obvious expenses – their approach amounts to a tax on everyday life.

Increased user fees for campsites, fishing licenses and passports are one part of
their plan. Continuously increasing taxes on beer and wine is another. By 2022,
Trudeau’s carbon tax will increase the price of gasoline by 11 cents per litre,
making any family road trip a lot more expensive.

On top of all of it are year-round tax hikes on public transit, ridesharing services
like Uber, and kids’ sports and arts activities.

Justin Trudeau claims the best of intentions, but his policies hurt the very people
he says they want to help.

They came to office saying they wanted to help families, but they’re now treating
summertime family activities as a source of tax revenue to cover their spending
problem.

Lower taxes mean the government has faith in the everyday men and women of Canada to
make the best decisions for themselves and their families. This is how we create
prosperity and opportunity for everyone in Canada, no matter who you are.

This is what Conservatives believe in.

And these everyday families are who Canada’s Conservatives are here to fight for.

612,20170907,Andrew Scheer,"By now, you’ve heard…","Hi Mike,

By now you’ve heard about Justin Trudeau’s plan to raise taxes on Canadian
businesses, doctors, and farmers.

I sure have – and as I’ve travelled around the country, I’ve heard from countless
Canadians that will be affected by such a tax hike.

Let me be crystal clear: Canada’s Conservatives stand strongly against tax hikes such
as this one.

It should be the goal of every elected official to help local Canadian businesses
grow and create prosperity. Clearly, that goal is not shared by the Liberal
government.

>> Help us fight for LOWER taxes! <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?lang=en&?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]

Justin Trudeau calls the people running these mom and pop shops, doctors’ offices,
and local farms ‘cheats.’ He couldn’t be more wrong.

These people are the backbone of the Canadian economy – the ones who not only hire
young people and help employees toward retirement, but also actively support their
communities, their families, and charities. They represent the very best of the
Canadian entrepreneurial spirit, and they deserve much better than this.

Justin Trudeau’s tax hikes will:

Make it harder for Canadians to find a family doctor and increase wait times;  Make
life harder for farm families and make it more expensive for Canadians to buy local
produce;  Discourage young Canadians from starting their own businesses;  Result in
layoffs, fewer working hours, and reduced health insurance and other benefits;  Make
Canadian businesses uncompetitive; and  Drive away investment.

Justin Trudeau has to raise taxes because he has irresponsibly spent his way into a
path of decades-long deficits and mounting debt.

We have called on him to STOP his reckless ways, but he refuses to listen.

He will only hurt Canadian job creation by forcing entrepreneurs and all those who
work for local businesses to pay for his mistake.

Canada’s Conservatives believe taxes should be lower for all Canadians: for job
creators, families, and individuals.

We are calling on Justin Trudeau to listen to the millions of middle class Canadians
who are speaking out against this, and cancel his plan to fund a Liberal spending
spree on the backs of local Canadian business owners.

If you’re with us, please help us continue fighting for you with a  $38 donation
right now. [https://donate.conservative.ca/?lang=fr&?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]

613,20170908,Conservative Party of Canada,71% of Canadians agree,"Dear Mike,

Despite what the Liberals try to tell you, convicted terrorist Omar Khadr was not
entitled to the reported $10.5 million.

The payment was made voluntarily by Justin Trudeau.

The courts did not order the payout.

And saying it would cost less to pay up now is simply not true.

Canadians are outraged.  A recent survey says 71% of Canadians, from across all
political stripes agree with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer that this payout was
wrong.

Here’s what just some had to say:

""Let's not have Canadians forget this happened. Keep Trudeau accountable on
everything until the next election.""

– Rod

""I just don't understand how the Prime Minister can make a decision like this without
the rest of the government having a say in the matter.""

– Carolyn

""We should have a petition signed by Canadians apologizing to the American people and
especially Speer's widow to let them know we do not support our Liberal government on
the payout Omar Khadr received.""

- Kerry

""As a retired member of the Canadian Forces this went way beyond a slap in the face.""

- Cameron

Canadians have strong feelings about this case and we will continue to hold the
Trudeau Liberals to account on this matter.

Sincerely,

616,20170914,=?utf-8?Q?Erin_O=e2=80=99Toole?=,Where to even begin?,"Dear Mike,

Taxpayers, small business owners, seniors are all under attack!

>From whom, you ask?

The Trudeau Liberals – a government more concerned about their own best interests,
and those of their friends, than hard working Canadians.

Did you know that under the leadership of Justin Trudeau Canadians are already paying
a whopping 42.5% of their income towards taxes?

That’s more than the cost of “housing, food, and clothing combined” according to the
non-partisan Fraser Institute.

And things are about to get worse as the Liberals try to ram through tax code changes
that will dramatically increase the costs of doing business for working professionals
– this includes farmers, tradespeople, and thousands of small business owners.

Canada’s most vulnerable seniors are also going to feel the pinch as Trudeau’s tax
changes to the CPP will bump almost a quarter of a million low income seniors from
being able to qualify for the “Guaranteed Income Supplement.”

On the flip side, if you’re a former Liberal candidate and a friend of Trudeau’s top
aide, then fear not - life will be just fine.

Just ask Rana Sakar, who was handed a plum diplomatic post in California at nearly
twice the official salary rate.  As “one of the highest-paid Canadian diplomats”,
Rana can expect a salary in the range of $260,000, a “five-bedroom house” in San
Francisco “worth millions”, and “regular trips” to Hawaii.

Justin Trudeau has a spending problem and he wants you to pay for it!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]

Canada’s Conservatives believe small business owners are the backbone of our economy.
They, alongside the workers they hire, deserve a break – as do seniors who worked
their entire lives to enjoy retirement.

Let’s send Trudeau a message that hard working Canadians - not his well-connected
friends! - deserve a break.

623,20170921,Cory Hann,Local business under attack!,"Dear Mike,

Farmers, and other local business owners and job creators in our communities, are
under attack!

Despite mounting pressure from all sides, the Liberals doubled down on their policies
that will hurt the very people they claim to help.

Lost in all of the debate is that fact that foreign investors are anxious to snap up
world-famous Canadian farmland and rent it back to our farmers at exorbitant prices.

Now the Liberals are going to make that easier than ever!

Their new tax hikes will apply a 45% dividend tax on the sale of farmland from
parents to children.

However, after the hike, there will still be zero tax on the sale to a foreign-owned
conglomerate.

Why are the Trudeau Liberals helping foreign businesses turn our farmers into tenants
of foreign landlords?

Hurting local farmers that create jobs is dangerous to the livelihoods of farm
families across Canada - and there is nothing “fair” about that.

There is an alternative for Canadian taxpayers and concerned citizens – a
Conservative Party that respects local farmers and the jobs they create.

We will fight these tax hikes every step of the way.  But we can’t do it without your
help.

We’re trying to spread the word with a new Save Local Business campaign.

624,20170922,Save Local Business!,Looking after their own,"Dear Mike,

Did you know the average local business owner receives no employer pension, no
vacation pay, no sick leave, and no paid days off?

These people drive our economy. They work hard, take risks, provide for their
families, and create jobs and opportunity for millions of other Canadians.

But to the Trudeau Liberals, these hard working business owners are just the latest
revenue generating tool to pay for their own out-of-control spending habits!

Under Trudeau’s latest tax grab plan, when local small business owners try to save
money for a future emergency or their retirement, they will be taxed at a rate of 73%
on their investment income.

Large publicly traded companies, like Bombardier, will not.

Why is the government hitting our middle-class entrepreneurs with a much higher tax
rate than the Liberals’ billionaire friends in the biggest corporations in the land?

To put things into perspective, under Trudeau’s proposal:

A pizza shop owner who puts aside money to earn a little interest to save for a rainy
day and eventually pulls it out for retirement would pay 73% in taxes.

But a Morneau Sheppel executive who has shares in the company will pay about 50% in
taxes on this passive investment.

If the Liberals are really interested in helping the middle class, why are they
hitting the pizza shop owner with a much higher tax rate than the billionaire Bay
Street executive?

As an added insult, the Liberals are actually trying to claim their tax plan is about
making things “fair”.

The Conservative Party of Canada will fight to save local businesses, and the jobs
they create.

That’s why we have created the Save Local Business campaign, to encourage Canadians
to reach out and show their support for local businesses across the country.

628,20170928,Conservative Party of Canada,Omar Khadr,"Dear Mike,

Two months later, the Omar Khadr payout remains top of mind for many Canadians.

They still have a hard time reconciling Justin Trudeau’s choice to hand over $10.5
million to a convicted terrorist – in secret.

Surely Mr. Trudeau understood making the payment behind closed doors would mean
Tabitha Speer and her children – the family of Omar Khadr’s victim, Sgt. Christopher
Speer – could be denied any access to the compensation money.

And as the facts continue to make their way into the public consciousness, the
majority of Canadians still denounce the payment – and we couldn’t agree more.

Recent polling shows:

6 in 10 Canadians disapprove of the deal  44% of Canadians say the payout will affect
their vote in the next election

Canadians have strong opinions about this. And thousands have signed up to voice
their disapproval at  KhadrQuestions.ca [http://www.khadrquestions.ca].

There are still many questions about Justin Trudeau’s decision to give a taxpayer
funded payday to a convicted terrorist responsible for killing an ally’s army medic.

We asked them all through the summer.

You’ve asked them all through the summer.

We’ll be asking the Trudeau government all these questions – and many more – in this

629,20170929,Jaime Girard,It’s almost that time!,"Dear Mike,

Earlier this week the Liberals sent out a fundraising email accusing Conservatives of
running “attack” ads.

I couldn’t help but laugh at their fear-mongering.

What the Liberals were actually talking about was our  Save Local Business
[https://donate.conservative.ca/savelocalbusiness?mpi=kddldyt&val=35] campaign. The
campaign that has informed Canadians of the Liberals’ plan to dramatically raise
taxes on our country’s best and brightest entrepreneurs.

The local bakery, your favorite pizza shop, the mom and pop corner store – all
painted as tax cheats by Justin Trudeau that must pay up to feed the Liberal spending
addiction.

Frankly, the attack isn’t from us – it’s an attack from the Trudeau Liberals on
Canada’s job creators.

Thanks to your support, not only have we got this issue recognized across the
country, but we have also out fundraised the Liberals in every quarter this year – so
far.

After this Liberal threat to dramatically raise taxes on local businesses, the
Liberals’ popularity is sliding — and Andrew Scheer’s is soaring.

So it’s understandable the Liberals are defaulting to their old false accusations to
change the channel.

Let’s send them a message, shall we?

As you know, Canada’s Conservatives have been fighting Trudeau’s latest tax hike for
weeks now.

This evening, I’m proud to say that we introduced, and voted together on, the
following motion:

“That the House call on the government to continue, until January 31, 2018, its
consultations on proposed changes to the taxation of private corporations as outlined
in the Minister of Finance’s paper “Tax Planning Using Private Corporations”,
released July 18, 2017.”

Sadly, the Liberals voted against it!

They used their majority to vote down the motion, thus putting an abrupt end to their
sham of a consultation process.

Last week, government officials testified before the House of Commons’ Standing
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.

When asked pointed questions about the percentage of asylum claims by those coming to
Canada illegally, and the percentage of those claims being rejected, officials didn't
answer.

However: Reports say Canada is only able to process 14,500 asylum seekers each year
with existing resources.

So far in 2017, over 32,000 asylum seekers have made their way into Canada.

That number is expected to hit 40,000 by year end.

Regarding the crisis and the governments’ inability to get answers during the
committee, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said it best:

“Canada is an open and generous country, and we have a responsibility to help the
most vulnerable fleeing from violence.  However, the Liberal government’s continued
lack of transparency and general approach to the illegal border crossing situation is
outrageous. How can Canadians have confidence in Justin Trudeau’s ability to manage
Canada’s immigration system if his government is not even able to provide basic
information?""

Last week, thousands of men and women who rely upon the energy sector for well-paying
Canadian jobs got the news that they have been dreading.

The Energy East Project is dead.

Andrew Scheer’s initial tweet summed the situation up perfectly:

Energy East was a shovel-ready project that would have created thousands of Canadian
jobs.

And the decision to cancel it is a direct result of two years of complete
mismanagement and incompetence by the Trudeau Liberals!

Failure is the only word that comes to mind.

The Liberals’ dysfunctional regulatory process and incoherent energy policies are
hurting Canadians.

The Liberals have handed a huge advantage to oil companies operating in places like
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria.

Some estimates say this has cost 15,000 Canadians a job, and hurt our economy to the
tune of $55 billion.

This hurts the middle class - you know, the group Trudeau claims to be supporting,
but in reality is actually hurting the most with his poor decisions!

637,20171012,Pierre Poilievre,New Liberal Tax on Employee Discounts Would Target the Working Class,"Dear Mike,

Trudeau’s tax hikes strike again!

You won’t believe what he’s going after now. Read on…

“Because it’s 2015” became the benchmark phrase for what it means to be part of
Trudeau’s Liberal Government.

In 2017 it has a whole new meaning: deeper deficits and increased taxes across the
board.

Help us get Canada back on track!
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]

It wasn’t long after the 2015 election that Trudeau broke his promise on running
“modest” deficits, plunging Canada into a deeper deficit than anyone could imagine.

Next, Trudeau committed to forcing a carbon tax onto Canadians, which will make
everything more expensive - and our economy less competitive.

And now in 2017, it’s a new tax on small business owners, local job creators, and
entrepreneurs.

But believe it or not, the Liberal Party, who claim to be the protectors of the
middle-class, have shown their true colours once again – by proposing a new tax on…
employee discounts.

That’s right – if you work as a waitress and want to order a burger after your shift,
or if you work in the mall and get a discount on a new pair of jeans, you better
believe that the Liberals have their sights set on you!

Trudeau likes to pretend that he is going after “the wealthy” with his tax hikes.

But it is clear that this latest Liberal tax increase will target those who can least
afford to pay more.

Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau’s ‘family fortune’, as he likes to call it, will be
untouched once again.

Trudeau attacked our local businesses and family farmers, calling them tax cheats.

And now he has unleashed the tax collectors to hound all hardworking Canadians for
more money.

Conservatives believe in freeing people to earn a better life for themselves and
their families.

We will fight for hard working everyday Canadians - the very people Justin Trudeau
claims to help, but actually hurts with his endless tax hikes.

When we form government in 2019, we’ll bring in policies to help Canadians, not hurt
them.

A donation by you today of $38 will go a long way to making sure we stop Justin
Trudeau and the Liberals in 2019.

638,20171013,Conservative Party of Canada,Trudeau failing Canada on immigration,"Dear Mike,

Justin Trudeau is failing Canada on immigration.

1 : Illegal border crossers.

Despite the decrease in media attention, this problem has not gone away. In fact, it
has only gotten worse.

People continue to walk across the border – illegally! – while Trudeau does nothing.

Canada is able to process 14,500 asylum seekers each year. But over 32,000 have made
their way to Canada this year – and that number is expected to hit 40,000 by year
end.

Government officials were grilled on the percentage of these claims being rejected.
They didn’t answer.

Trudeau clearly has no plan to deal with this crisis. If he did, we wouldn't see a
refugee tent city at our border. Nor would we be forced to use a stadium to house
migrants.

It’s simple: this increase in illegal border crossing is putting a huge strain on
Canada’s resources.

What the Liberals have allowed to happen in Quebec and across other border towns
shortchanges thousands who are legally working their way through our refugee system.

2 : Criminals seeking asylum from Mexico.

Late last year, Trudeau lifted the Visa requirement for Mexico.

At that time, border officials expressed great concern that the policy change would
make it “easier for Mexican criminals to enter the country.”

The numbers seem to back that up - in 2015, 111 asylum claims from Mexican nationals
were made. In 2016, it was around 250. So far in 2017, there have been 946.

""More violent criminals entering Canada from Mexico after Liberal decision to lift
visa requirements.""

– Global News, July 6, 2017

Justin Trudeau is ignoring facts, and this puts our country’s security at risk.

Canada’s Conservatives believe in putting the safety of Canadians first.

We believe in policies that help the people who truly need it the most.

Fresh off weeks of negative coverage surrounding their unfair tax changes and massive
tax hike on the middle class, the Liberals are now trying to change the channel by...
implementing the Conservative Party’s small business tax cut.

Stephen Harper lowered the small business tax rate. And in 2015, he committed to
lowering it even further, from 11% to 9%.

During the election, when the Liberals would say anything to get elected, Justin
Trudeau first said he’d match our tax break for small businesses.

However, the Liberals broke that promise in 2016, and reversed our planned cut.

And now in 2017, as you know, the Liberals are planning on raising taxes on local
businesses and family farms.

So today, in an effort to change the channel and maybe stop the terrible headlines,
Trudeau announced he is going re-promise to lower the small business tax rate to 9%
after all.

Justin Trudeau claims this was all part of his plan – but we know that is not true.

Justin Trudeau is raising taxes on the middle class, the very people he claims to be
helping.

Canadians are waking up to the high-tax hypocrisy of this Liberal government,
including Trudeau’s self-proclaimed “family fortune” which will be left untouched by
his tax hikes.

There is nothing “fair” about that.

Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted. He broke his promise before. He’ll break it again.

The Prime Minister only made this announcement today because local business operators
are speaking out in opposition to this tax grab.

Once we let our guard down, he’ll raise the small business tax rate again – he’s done
it before.

Canada’s Conservatives have been fighting this high-tax agenda every step of the way.
And we will continue to do so.

Will you  help us [https://donate.conservative.ca?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38] win in
2019 and bring common sense back to government?

641,20171018,Michael Chong,What a waste!,"Dear Mike,

I wish I could say the Liberals 2017 Budget only cost taxpayers $212,000...but that's
just for the cost of the cover!

There could be no better example of how each party treats taxpayer money!

But it gets worse!  The Liberals also spent more than $176,000 for cover art for the
2016 Budget.

As reported in the media, our Conservative government “published budgets with a plain
blue cover or inexpensive stock photos purchased from commercial distributors for
$600 or less.”

Why?  Because our party respects the taxpayer and their tax dollars!

We’ve been working hard to share our positive vision for Canada as we get closer to
the election in 2019.

Lower taxes, a strong economy, and bringing forward policies that unite Canadians are
what a government should be focused on – not ensuring the artwork colour scheme
concepts for the Budget document look “fresh” – at a cost of nearly a quarter of a
million dollars.

Help us bring some sensibility back to Ottawa – please support our effort to win the
election in 2019 with a donation of $38 today.

642,20171019,Cory Hann,What a week,"Dear Mike,

It’s been an interesting start to this Parliamentary session from where I sit.

More and more when I do my media scans in the morning I’ve been noticing a trend that
should leave any Liberal communications staffer awake at night.

It’s a trend one can only assume should be shaking the halls of PMO and Liberal HQ.

Long gone are the days of instant and automatic fawning over the Prime Minister and
his socks.

It seems the media and the public are getting a little tired of Trudeau’s rambling
talking points, his catch phrases, and doing all he can to avoid answering tough
questions.

And you wouldn’t believe the blowback Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau faced, following their feeble attempt to change the channel
on the fury over their small business tax hike.

Don’t believe me? Just take a look at some of these headlines:

With each passing day, more and more Canadians understand when Trudeau or his
Minister’s speak, all they get is lip service.

A catchy slogan and good vibes won’t get the job done!

Canada’s Conservatives believe in uniting Canadians together to build a better future
for our children and grandchildren. We believe in polices that raise people up so
that we are all successful. We’re principled and motivated by what is best for
everyone in this country.

When the same policies Justin Trudeau claims are helping people are actually the very
policies that are hurting Canadians most, that’s when we know the Liberals have gone
wrong.

A positive Conservative vision like the one Andrew Scheer has presented is what
Canadians need now more than ever.

We will get our country back on the right path to prosperity.

Join us as we chart that path, and the path to an election victory in 2019, by

Today marks the two year anniversary since the last election.

That means we've had:

two years of Trudeau tax hikes;

two years of Liberal entitlement;

and two years of policies that have hurt the very same people Justin Trudeau claims
he's helping.

track.

their big spending and massive taxes.

In 2017 our party reached a record number of members, and elected Andrew Scheer as
our new party leader. Since then Andrew has travelled the country to share his
positive Conservative vision with Canadians.

And what have the Liberals accomplished over the past two years?

Higher taxes

Multiple investigations by ethics and lobbying watchdogs

Buried Canada in billions of new debt

With just days to go until Halloween, here’s a scary thought to ponde – a second
Justin Trudeau term.

648,20171025,Conservative Party of Canada,Fiscal update? Just higher taxes.,"Dear Mike,

Today, Justin Trudeau presented a fall economic update.

What did it contain? You guessed it.

More spending.  Higher deficits.  And no end in sight to the ever-mounting Liberal
debt!

Today’s update promises all kinds of new goodies - paid for by you, of course.

But all the expensive promises wrapped in flowery language won’t fool Canadians.

When they say they’re giving you a break, there is no reason to believe them.

We’re WAY past that now.

>> Help us bring integrity back to Ottawa <<
[https://donate.conservative.ca/?mpi=[campaignid]&val=38]

The Liberals blew through their 2015 promise of “modest” deficits.

They’ve racked up tens of billions of dollars in new spending.

Now they need you to pay for it:

First, it was the promise of a carbon tax, which will drive up the cost of
everything.

Then, they planned a massive tax hike on local businesses.

Then, they went after retail workers and their employee discounts.

Now, they’re attacking people with diabetes - yes, we’re serious - by denying their
benefit claims.

While all this was happening, we learned that Finance Minister Bill Morneau himself:

Broke the ethics rules when he failed to report his off-shore company in France;

Didn’t put his millions of dollars of shares of his family company in a blind trust
even after he suggested he would; and

Introduced pension legislation that could profit his family’s business.

Could the blatant hypocrisy be any more stunning?!

Here is the good news: we can put an end to this!

We can bring sanity and fairness back to Ottawa.

The next election is now less than two years away, and we are already working hard to
prepare.

Help us replace Trudeau in 2019 with a $38 donation today!

When Justin Trudeau gives with one hand, he’s always taking more with the other.

And today, my message to hard-working Canadians is simple.  You cannot trust Justin
Trudeau to give you a tax break.  His policies hurt the very people he claims to help
– the middle class.

If higher taxes on gas, home heating, hydro, and personal savings weren’t enough, the
Trudeau Liberals are even raising taxes on life saving treatments for people with
diseases like diabetes.

They only back down when they get caught.

So when Justin Trudeau promises he won’t raise taxes – I just don’t believe him.

It’s in the Liberals' DNA!  They will never allow themselves to run out of other
people’s money.

Conservatives have forced Justin Trudeau to back down from his latest tax hikes – but
we know the next new tax is just around the corner.

You can count on us to fight these tax hikes –  every step of the way.

650,20171028,Lisa Raitt,Such a shame,"Dear Mike,

While the Liberals have been busy raising taxes on just about everyone, all while
shielding the personal fortunes of the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, a
very important story broke a couple weeks ago that also deserved a lot of attention.

TransCanada Corp was forced to pull the plug on the Energy East project after
encountering Justin Trudeau’s red tape.

Ok, so a pipeline project got shut down. No big deal, right?

Wrong.

Energy East would have been one of the most ambitious nation building infrastructure
projects in the history of Canada.

It was a shovel-ready job that would have employed thousands of Canadians.

It would have moved 1.1 million barrels of crude oil from Alberta to Saint John every
day.

It would have made Canada more energy independent, and less reliant on foreign
countries like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria.

But instead, Justin Trudeau's job-killing policies created too many unnecessary
complications and killed the project.

Trudeau’s economic strategy is clearly to raise taxes on ordinary Canadians, and shut
down projects that create jobs and prosperity.

Canada's Conservatives know that such a plan simply won’t work.

We will work to put people back to work and get the energy sector rolling again.

We will unite Canada, reduce red tape, and support job creating projects like Energy
East!

But of course we can’t do that without your support.

Halloween is a spooky time of year.

This year, it is especially scary for hard-working taxpayers!

The Trudeau Liberals have perfected the art of tricking Canadians, with very few
treats to be found.

The Liberals promised Canadians a lot of treats back in 2015.

But since then all they have delivered is tricks.

This weekend we even learned other Liberal Ministers are also using the same loophole
as Bill Morneau to shelter their personal wealth.

That's right -- the same Liberal Ministers who called hardworking local business
operators ""tax cheats"" have been caught bending the rules to their own advantage.

Enough is enough.

You are all awesome!

Thank you to each of our supporters.

Canada’s Conservatives are stronger than ever!

At the end of the 3rd quarter, we put out a call for support – and our supporters
stood up and delivered!

Check this out:

We out fundraised the Liberals in the last quarter by half a million dollars: CPC
$3.6 million - LPC $3.1 million.

We received generous donations from almost 3,500 more donors than the Liberals: CPC
32,211 - LPC 29,768.

And we have topped 100,000 donors this year already: CPC 107,111 – LPC 91,729.

A new leader, a positive vision for Canada’s Conservatives, and strong support right
across the country!

These are the ingredients that will allow our party to effectively oppose the
Liberals – and form government in 2019.

But to do that, we must keep pushing harder than ever!

Winning campaigns takes sound policies and great volunteers – but it also takes a lot
of money!

So, while our numbers look great – we can do even better.

Q4 is well under way.  Will you help us finish the year strong and continue to out-
fundraise the Liberals – right up until the end of the year?

Your donation of $35 today will go a long way towards making that happen.

You may have heard about the Q3 fundraising results that came out earlier this week.

Simply put: we did very well.

We raised more money, from more donors, than the Liberals.

This time last year, they were neck and neck with us.

And things look good for Q4 so far, too:

In a series of emails earlier this week, the Liberals asked their supporters to help
them hit their October goal of raising $100,000 online before midnight on Oct 31.

I can tell you: we raised double that online in October.

There are two reasons we are doing so well right now:

After endless scandals and tax hikes, Canadians are realizing that Justin Trudeau and
Bill Morneau are actually hurting the same middle class they claim to help.

Andrew Scheer and our Conservative team are presenting our positive vision for the
future of Canada, and Canadians are clearly responding!
